<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>We are currently updating the grading scheme for this class, so parts of this page are still
under construction. Full details on the grading scheme will be available during
the first week of the quarter. That said, the coursework that will have an impact on your final
grade will be the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Homework Assignments</p></li>
<li><p>Project, divided into:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Team Design Exercise</p></li>
<li><p>Individual work on issues/tasks</p></li>
<li><p>Peer Feedback</p></li>
<li><p>Final Presentation</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see the <a class="reference external" href="project/policies.html">Project Policies</a> page for more details
on the coursework involved in the project, but please bear in mind that we are
in the process of updating that page too.</p>
</div>
<p>This year (2022), we have overhauled the grading scheme in CMSC 22000, and are following a <em>specifications grading</em> approach. Many of you have likely not encountered specifications grading before, so we encourage you to carefully read this page to make sure you understand how it works.</p>
<div class="section" id="coursework-grading-scale">
<h2>Coursework Grading Scale<a class="headerlink" href="#coursework-grading-scale" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Specifications grading is a learning-focused approach that prioritizes student learning over scores or grades. A key aspect of specifications grading is to provide opportunities for students to learn from their mistakes and demonstrate growth and
improvement throughout the quarter.</p>
<p>However, the traditional 0-100 grading scale makes it challenging for a student to understand
if their work needs improvement (and how much improvement). For example, getting 85 points out of 100 on a project could be considered an excellent
performance in one class, but a dismal score in a different class. Providing medians and quartiles may not be helpful,
as it only tells you how you performed relative to the rest of the class; again, 85 points might be an excellent score
in an absolute sense, but may lead you to believe it’s a poor score because everyone else in the class happened to
do much better than you.</p>
<p>So, this year, coursework in this class will be scored according to the following scale:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Excellent</strong> (E): The work is either perfect, or has only very minor flaws.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Satisfactory</strong> (S): While the work has some room for improvement, the student has put in a good-faith effort to complete all the work and demonstrated sufficient mastery of the material. Only minor revisions would be needed for the work to be Excellent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Needs Improvement</strong> (N): The student has put in a good-faith effort to complete the work, but revealed a lack of mastery in the material that can be addressed via concrete feedback. The work could become Satisfactory or Excellent with some major revisions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ungradable</strong> (U): The student did not make a good-faith effort to complete the work. This includes not submitting the work at all, but also situations like submitting only placeholder code, work that barely passes any tests, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is often referred to as the ESNU scale. It is important that you avoid thinking of these scores in terms of how they map to an A, B, C, etc. (the manner in which we compute your final grade is described below). The ESNU scale is intended to help you understand your mastery of the material, so you can identify areas for improvement as the quarter progresses. All assigned work will include a more precise specification of what is required for an E, S, N, or U in that particular piece of work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resubmissions">
<h2>Resubmissions<a class="headerlink" href="#resubmissions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Another key aspect of specifications grading is lowering the stakes of any individual assignment. In other words,
a poor performance in one assignment should not tank your grade for the entire quarter, and (as noted earlier)
there should be an opportunity for you to demonstrate you’ve learned from those mistakes and are able to
improve your work.</p>
<p>One way of accomplishing this is by allowing students to submit a revised version of their work after
they’ve gotten feedback from the graders. In this class, you will be allowed to resubmit your work as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Homeworks</strong>: You are allowed to resubmit <strong>at most two</strong> homeworks. Once a homework is returned to you,
you will typically have one week to submit a revised version that addresses any feedback you received
from the graders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Individual Project Tasks</strong>: While you will not be able to resubmit tasks themselves, the project is
structured in such a way that there are multiple (and potentially unbound) opportunities to earn scores
via the project tasks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Project Design Warm-up</strong>: The Design Warm-up is divided into two parts. You will receive feedback on
the first part before the second part is due, but you will also have a chance to submit a revised version
after the second part is returned to you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Peer Feedback</strong>: There are two rounds of peer feedback, and only the second round will affect your
final grade. If there are any concerns with the quality of your first round of feedback, you will get
the highest score possible in the second round as long as those concerns are addressed.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="late-submissions">
<h2>Late Submissions<a class="headerlink" href="#late-submissions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Late submissions will not be accepted in this class, except under extraordinary circumstances. Please bear in mind
that, given that you can resubmit most of the work in the class, it is ok to submit a less-than-ideal piece of work by the
deadline, as you will have an opportunity to revise it later on.</p>
<p>That said, to be clear: <strong>if you encounter some sort of emergency (medical, family, etc.) please reach out to us as soon as you are able to do so</strong>. We are more than happy to find ways to provide additional flexibility in these situations. Ideally, you should notify us of these circumstances before the work is due so we can discuss options with you.</p>
<p>In other words, our late submission policy applies to <em>ordinary</em> circumstances: if you are having a busy week, if your RSO has an event that overlaps with a deadline, etc., then you should rely on the resubmission policy to give you some extra flexibility: instead of trying to argue for a few extra days to work on an assignment, you should just submit the work you have completed by the deadline, so you can get feedback on that work and use that feedback to improve your work.</p>

<div class="section" id="final-grade">
<h2>Final Grade<a class="headerlink" href="#final-grade" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>We are currently finalizing the exact scheme by which the final grade
will be computed. We expect these details to be available during the first
week of the quarter.</p>
