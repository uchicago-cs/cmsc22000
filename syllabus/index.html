<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>Developing a software system (e.g., an application, a web server, an operating system, etc.) requires much more than just knowing how to program. Software development encompasses multiple activities, such as systems design, implementation, testing, debugging, deployment, documentation, and maintenance, all weaved together by following a specific methodology. Not just that, software development is a highly collaborative activity, where certain soft skills, like effective communication and the ability to give/receive feedback, can be key to the success of a software project.</p>
<p>This class bridges the gap between knowing how to program and knowing how to develop software: it is intended for students who have recently completed CMSC 15200 Introduction to Computer Science 2 or CMSC 16200 Honors Introduction to Computer Science 2, and will cover fundamental concepts and skills in software development, providing a solid foundation before students move on to majors-level classes that require developing complex software systems. The class will cover foundational topics in software development in lectures, but will also include hands-on labs, guest lectures from industry speakers, and a collaborative quarter-long project, where the entire class, divided into teams with specific responsibilities, will work on developing new features for an existing software system.</p>
<p>In this course, students will learn how to&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>&hellip; follow a software development process/methodology to manage the life cycle of a software system.</li>
<li>&hellip; use tools that support the software development process (e.g., build systems, testing frameworks, debuggers, etc.)</li>
<li>&hellip; develop software collaboratively through (a) the use of tools, systems, and best practices available to facilitate that collaboration (e.g., version control systems, code reviews, task tracking, etc.), and (b) exercising collaborative soft skills (communication, giving/accepting feedback, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Students must have taken CMSC 15200 or CMSC 16200.</p>
<p>In Spring 2021, students will have to apply to participate in this class, and only students who took CMSC 15200 or CMSC 16200 in Spring 2020, Summer 2020, Autumn 2020, or Winter 2021 will be invited to apply (<em>absolutely no exceptions will be made</em>).</p>
<p>Please note that CMSC 15400 is <em>not</em> a prerequisite for this class. Students who are taking CMSC 15200/16200 in Winter 2021, and who end up taking CMSC 22000, are strongly encouraged to defer CMSC 15400 until the Fall, instead of taking CMSC 22000 and CMSC 15400 concurrently.</p>
<h2 id="course-organization">Course Organization</h2>
<p>This class will be run online, with no in-person components.</p>
<p>Lectures are scheduled to take place on MWF 3:00pm - 3:50pm, but please note that, in Spring 2021, we will generally only meet on Mondays and Fridays for discussion-oriented meetings over Zoom, with most of the course content delivered via pre-recorded lectures. We may, in some weeks, host guest talks from outside speakers on Wednesdays.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have time reserved on Mondays 4:30pm-5:50pm for project teams meetings (this is listed as a &ldquo;lab&rdquo; on the Registrar&rsquo;s site, but please note that it is unrelated to the lab assignments in this class). Team meetings will start on Week 3.</p>
<p>A large part of the class will revolve around the development of a software project where students will be able to apply many of the concepts covered in the lectures (this project is described in more detail in the &ldquo;Course Project&rdquo; section below). In this project, the entire class will work on the same code (through public GitHub repositories visible to the entire class). Students will be divided into teams of 4-5 students, and each team will work on a specific aspect of the project. In each team, a TA will act as the senior developer in the team. Students will be assessed both on their performance as a team, as well as on their performance on individual tasks assigned to them in their teams.</p>
<p>Lab assignments will supplement the material covered in lectures, and will allow students to learn and practice skills that will be necessary in the course project. Please note that there is no actual lab session; instead, these are self-guided labs to do in your own time, and with a number of exercises that have to be done individually before a given deadline.</p>
<p>During the first two weeks of the quarter, the class will focus on covering core concepts regarding the software development process. Starting in week 3, the focus of the class will shift towards the development of the course project, with Mondays used for a project all-hands meeting, and each team having a 30-minute meeting with the team&rsquo;s senior developer during lab hours.</p>
<h2 id="course-contents">Course Contents</h2>
<p>Please see the <a href="/cmsc22000/calendar/">Course Calendar</a> page.</p>
<h2 id="course-project">Course Project</h2>
<p>The course project revolves around developing a complex software system. The scope and complexity of this project will require that the entire class work together towards developing a fully-featured software product.</p>
<p>More specifically, the entire class will be working on the same codebase. The class will be divided into teams of 4-5 students, with an undergraduate TA acting as a &ldquo;senior developer&rdquo; in each of these teams (TAs will be students who have previously taken CMSC 22000 and/or who have prior industry experience via internships) Teams will be arranged by the instructor/TAs (they will not be self-selecting).</p>
<p>During Weeks 2-3, the teams will work on a warmup exercise on software design. A design exercise will be assigned in Week 2 (due Week 3), and a follow-up exercise will be assigned in Week 3 (due Week 4). Teams will get feedback on their first exercise before the second one is due, and there will be a Zoom session in Week 3 dedicated to discussing the design exercise.</p>
<p>Starting in Week 3, project planning will follow a Scrum-like process, with weeks 3-9 of the quarter being divided into several sprints. Starting on Week 3, all teams have an all-hands meeting during Monday class hours, and each team will have an additional team meeting during the lab section of the class. Teams will keep track of their tasks through GitHub issues, with grading primarily based on their performance on these tasks.</p>
<p>More details on the project can be found on the <a href="/cmsc22000/project/">Project</a> page.</p>
<h2 id="lecture-quizzes">Lecture Quizzes</h2>
<p>The pre-recorded lectures will include very simple quizzes that should be trivial to pass if you pay attention to the videos. The goal of these quizzes is to reward students who watch the pre-recorded lectures in a timely manner, and who pay attention while watching the videos.</p>
<p>To earn the points for a quiz, you must complete the quiz no later than one week after the lecture is posted. Furthermore, if your total score on the quizzes (for the entire quarter) is above 75%, you will get 100% of the points allocated to the lecture quizzes on your final grade. If your total score on the quizzes is below below 75%, you will be awarded a proportional amount of the points.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Grading is based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>25% Lab Assignments (each lab weighed equally)</li>
<li>5% Lecture Quizzes</li>
<li>70% Project, divided into:
<ul>
<li>5% Team Design Exercise</li>
<li>35% Individual Evaluation</li>
<li>15% Team Evaluation</li>
<li>5% Peer Feedback</li>
<li>10% Final Presentation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See the the <a href="/cmsc22000/project/">Project</a> page for more details on how the project scores are determined.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are 2 points of extra credit that are unlocked by completing a final goal in the course project (this goal is such that it can only be reached if all teams have substantially completed and integrated their work for the project). If these extra points are unlocked, they are awarded to everyone in the class.</p>
<p>Grades are not curved in this class or, at least, not in the traditional sense. We use a standard set of grade boundaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>95-100: A</li>
<li>90-95: A-</li>
<li>85-90: B+</li>
<li>80-85: B</li>
<li>75-80: B-</li>
<li>70-75: C+</li>
<li>&lt; 70: Dealt on a case-by-case basis</li>
</ul>
<p>We curve only to the extent that we may lower the boundaries for one or more letter grades, depending on the distribution of the raw scores.</p>
<h3 id="lab-assignment-regrades">Lab Assignment Regrades</h3>
<p>We sometimes make mistakes, and are happy to review any grading decision on the lab assignments that you feel is unfair or unjustified. However, it is also your responsibility to make these requests in a timely manner. Requests for regrades must be submitted no later than <strong>one week</strong> after a graded lab assignment is returned to you. After that time, we will not consider any requests for regrades, <em>regardless of whether the regrade request is reasonable and justified</em>.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>While this class does not have a required textbook, most of the Software Engineering content draws heavily from Ian Sommerville&rsquo;s book, <a href="http://iansommerville.com/software-engineering-book/">Software Engineering</a>. Please see <a href="/cmsc22000/resources/">Additional Resources</a> for a number of other books and online resources covering much of the material in this class.</p>
<h2 id="diversity-statement">Diversity Statement</h2>
<p>The University of Chicago is committed to diversity and rigorous inquiry that arises from multiple perspectives. We concur with that commitment and also believe that we have the highest quality interactions and can creatively solve more problems when we recognize and share our diversity. We thus expect to maintain a productive learning environment based upon open communication, mutual respect, and non-discrimination. We view the diversity that students bring to this class as a resource, strength and benefit. It is our intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, religious background, and immigration status. Any suggestions as to how to further such a positive and open environment in the class will be appreciated and given serious consideration.</p>
<p>If you have a preferred name different from what appears on the class roster, or preferred gender pronouns you would like us to use, please let us know.</p>
