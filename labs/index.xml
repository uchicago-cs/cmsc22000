      <description>If you have any questions or get stuck on the lab assignments, there are two ways of getting help:
Slack We have a #course-labs channel on our Slack workspace that can be used to ask questions about the lab assignments. However, to keep that channel tidy we ask that you follow a couple of conventions in this channel.

      <description>Due: Wednesday, April 15th, 8pm
 NOTE: This lab is based on a Linux and Git lab originally written by Anne Rogers for CMSC 12100 (and updated and edited by a variety of instructors and TAs throughout the years)  In some of your previous CS courses, you may have become familiar with using Subversion (SVN) to handle revision control (or version control) of your projects and assignments, and to submit your work for grading.</description>
