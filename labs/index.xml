      <title>How to submit your labs</title>

      <description>You will be submitting your labs using a tool called chisubmit that is available on the CS machines. Before using this tool, you first need to enable it inside your local repository. Just go into your local repository directory, and run the following:
chisubmit init  When asked for your username and password, just enter your CNetID and password. If there are no errors, you will now be able to run chisubmit from inside that directory.</description>

      <description>Due: Thursday, April 5th, 4pm
 NOTE: This lab is based on a Linux and Git lab originally written by Anne Rogers for CMSC 12100 (and updated and edited by a variety of instructors and TAs throughout the years)
  In some of your previous CS courses, you became familiar with using Subversion (SVN) to handle revision control (or version control) of your projects and assignments, and to submit your work for grading.</description>

      <description>Due: Thursday, April 12th, 4pm
In this lab, you will carry out some basic software design tasks. Before we get to those tasks, we need you to perform an additional (ungraded but necessary) Git-related task so you can fetch the files necessary for this lab.
Task 0: Pulling from upstream In the previous lab, you set up your local repo, which is set up by default to pull/push from/to a repository in our GitLab server.</description>

      <description>Due: Thursday, April 19th, 4pm
In the class project, you will be working with a large C project called Redis that is composed of hundreds and hundreds of C files. How do these files become the program called redis? In this lab, we’ll explore the ways a program can be “built”&amp;ndash;that is, the way that source code is turned into binary code so that a computer can execute it. In some cases, “building” may refer to compiling a single file, but usually it refers to the whole process of linking and creating a project: which can include linking, compiling, and running tests.</description>

      <description>Due: Thursday, April 26th, 4pm
In this lab, you will get some practice debugging a few programs and, in particular, will resolve some of the errors we described in class. In some of the tasks, you will also become more familiar with GDB, a popular debugger.
Task 0: Pulling from upstream (0 points)
You should already have the &amp;ldquo;upstream&amp;rdquo; remote set up in your repository. If you do, simply run</description>

      <title>Optional Lab: Advanced Git</title>

      <description>In the 150s/160s, as well as in the CS 220 labs, you have used version control systems (like Subversion and Git) essentially as a mechanism to store your code and to make it easily accessible to the course staff. However, in real software projects, version control systems are one of the most important tools that allow teams to collaborate on a shared code base.
In this lab, we will explore features of Git that are more directly related to collaborative software development, and which you will need to use during the course project.</description>

      <description>Due: Thursday, May 3rd, 4pm
By this point in your CS studies, you’ve probably experienced the following at least once:
 Your programming assignment is almost done, and everything works so far. Start working on the last task of the assignment. Make some minor changes. Run program. Everything stops working. The first task, the last task, and everything in between. Spend several hours debugging your code. Narrow down the issue to a silly mistake in the first task that only made things fail once the last task was implemented.</description>

      <title>Lab 6: Continuous Integration</title>

      <description>Due: Thursday, May 10th, 4pm
Continuous Integration, or CI, is the practice of frequently merging developers’ work into a mainline branch in a version control system like Git. CI almost always involves running an extensive set of test cases every time such a merge happens, or even every time new code is committed to the repository (not just on the mainline branch, but also on other branches). Thus many version control systems facilitate CI by providing mechanisms to trigger certain actions when code is pushed to a repository.</description>

      <title>Lab 7: Deployment</title>

      <description>Due: Thursday, May 17th, 4pm
Last week, you learned about Continuous Integration, which deals with how application code makes it to the master branch. But how do our applications make it to the real world, where other people can use them?
Deployment refers to the processes by which software systems are made available for use (a related term, delivery, refers to making software available specifically to end-users). The exact deployment pipeline can vary from one project to another.</description>

      <title>Lab 8: More CI and Deployment</title>
      <link>https://uchicago-cs.github.io/cmsc22000/labs/lab8/</link>

      <description>Due: Thursday, May 24th, 4pm
In this lab, we will continue to explore concepts related to Continuous Integration and Deployment. The lab is divided into two main parts: one where we will see how we can use Docker containers as part of a CI build, and one where we will expand the deployment pipeline we saw in our previous lab.
Part I: Using Containers in CI It is often necessary for a CI build to use a specific software environment to run a series of tests.</description>

      <title>Lab 9: Documentation and Logging</title>
      <link>https://uchicago-cs.github.io/cmsc22000/labs/lab9/</link>

      <description>Due: Thursday, May 31st, 4pm
This lab will be divided into two distinct parts: one focused on documentation, and another focused on logging. In the first one, you will automatically generate documentation for libgeometry and, in the second one, we will provide you with a program that simulates playing Tic-Tac-Toe under several different strategies, and you will add logging code to better track the progress of the simulation.
Part I: Documentation As we saw in class, there are many different ways of producing documentation, from adding a simple README file to your project, to writing more comprehensive documentation.</description>
