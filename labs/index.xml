      <description>You will be submitting your labs using a tool called chisubmit that is available on the CS machines. Before using this tool, you first need to enable it inside your local repository. Just go into your local repository directory, and run the following:
chisubmit init  When asked for your username and password, just enter your CNetID and password. If there are no errors, you will now be able to run chisubmit from inside that directory.</description>

      <description>Due: Thursday, April 11th, 2:30pm
 NOTE: This lab is based on a Linux and Git lab originally written by Anne Rogers for CMSC 12100 (and updated and edited by a variety of instructors and TAs throughout the years)
  In some of your previous CS courses, you became familiar with using Subversion (SVN) to handle revision control (or version control) of your projects and assignments, and to submit your work for grading.</description>
