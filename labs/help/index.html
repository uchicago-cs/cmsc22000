  <h1>Getting help on the lab assignments
</h1>

</header>

  <div class="container content">
  <p>If you have any questions or get stuck on the lab assignments, there are two ways of getting help:</p>
<h3 id="slack">Slack</h3>
<p>We have a <code>#course-labs</code> channel on our Slack workspace that can be used to ask questions about the lab assignments. However, to keep that channel tidy we ask that you follow a couple of conventions in this channel.</p>
<p>The most important convention is that there should be one &ldquo;thread&rdquo; per question. In Slack, you can reply to a message, creating a thread of replies under that message. This makes it easier to keep track of what messages are replying to a specific question (without threading, things can get messy if there are a lot of questions being asked at the same time).</p>
<p>So, if you wanted to ask a question, you would just post your question on the <code>#course-labs</code> channel:</p>
<p><img src="/cmsc22000/img/question-1.png" alt="Question on Slack" title="Question on Slack"></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that question was actually asked by someone else, and you wanted to reply to it. You must do so by starting a thread:</p>
<p><img src="/cmsc22000/img/question-2.png" alt="Starting a thread" title="Starting a thread"></p>
<p>You will be able to write a reply and, once you post it, it will appear under the original question:</p>
<p><img src="/cmsc22000/img/question-3.png" alt="Slack thread" title="Slack thread"></p>
<p>If you want to see the replies in an existing thread, you just need to click on the reply link (in the above example, you would click on &ldquo;1 reply&rdquo; and that would show you the existing replies, and will also allow you to provide your own reply). This will show you the replies, and will also allow you to write an additional reply:</p>
<p><img src="/cmsc22000/img/question-4.png" alt="Slack thread" title="Slack thread"></p>
<p>If you asked the original question, it&rsquo;s important for the course staff to know when your question has been answered to your satisfaction. If you feel your question has been resolved, you should add the &ldquo;resolved&rdquo; reaction to it. You can do this by clicking on &ldquo;Add reaction&rdquo;:</p>
<p><img src="/cmsc22000/img/question-5.png" alt="Adding a reaction" title="Adding a reaction"></p>
<p>And selecting the &ldquo;resolved&rdquo; emoji (note: this is an alias for the &ldquo;heavy_check_mark&rdquo; emoji; you can use that one as well)</p>
<p><img src="/cmsc22000/img/question-6.png" alt="Resolved reaction" title="Resolved reaction"></p>
<p>Note: An instructor or TA may also use the resolved emoji if they feel like the question has been resolved but, if it hasn&rsquo;t, you should feel free to remove the reaction, and post a reply on the thread to clarify that you still need assistance with that question.</p>
<p>You can read more about Slack threads <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organize-discussions-">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="zoom-office-hours">Zoom Office Hours</h3>
<p>You can also obtain one-on-one help via Zoom during scheduled office hours. To &ldquo;attend&rdquo; office hours, you must go into the <code>#course-office-hours</code> channel on Slack whenever office hours are in session (the times for office hours will be posted in a pinned message on that channel). Once you&rsquo;re in the channel, post a message with a brief description of your issue, and a Zoom meeting ID (this can be your personal meeting ID, or one created specifically for office hours). The instructor or TA running office hours will go through these messages, and visit each meeting to provide one-on-one help.</p>
<p>Note: If you are uncomfortable sharing a meeting ID on the channel, simply specify that you would like the instructor/TA to send you a private message once they&rsquo;re reading to see you, so you can then share a meeting ID with them privately.</p>
<p>When an instructor or TA joins your meeting, please share your screen with them if your question is going to involve looking at code or debugging of any sort (if you prefer, you can also share a single window, such as your code editor or a terminal). This is similar to how you would show an instructor/TA your laptop during normal office hours. During office hours, you may be asked to grant control to the instructor/TA over your screen. This can sometimes allow us to help you more interactively (similar to how an instructor/TA would type on your laptop in normal office hours), but please let us know if you would prefer not to do this.</p>
