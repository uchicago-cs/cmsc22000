<aside class="admonition warning">
<div class="admonition-icon"></div>
<div class="admonition-content"><strong>NOTE</strong>: This lab is based on a Linux and Git lab originally written by Anne Rogers for CMSC 12100 (and updated and edited by a variety of instructors and TAs throughout the years)</div>
</aside>
<p>In some of your previous CS courses, you may have become familiar with using Subversion (SVN) to handle revision control (or <em>version control</em>) of your projects and assignments, and to submit your work for grading. In this class, we will be using Git, a more widespread version control system that is more commonly used in a variety of software projects.</p>
<p>Like SVN, Git is a <em>version control system</em> that maintains files in a <em>repository</em> that contains not just files, but also a record of all the changes made to those files. Git tracks every version of a file or directory using <em>commits</em>. When you have made changes to one or more files, you can logically group those changes into a &ldquo;commit&rdquo; that gets added to your repository. You can think of commits as “checkpoints” in your work, representing the work you’ve done since the previous checkpoint. This mechanism makes it possible to look at and even revert to older versions of a file by going back to your code as it was when you “checkpointed” it with a commit.</p>
<p>For each lab assignment, a Git repository will be created for you on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. However, before that repository can be created for you, you need to have a GitHub account. If you do not yet have one, you can get an account here: <a href="https://github.com/join">https://github.com/join</a>. Once you create your account, you may want to get the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Student Developer Pack</a>, which will give you access to a lot of other features (please note that having the Student Developer Pack is not necessary for CS 220; it&rsquo;s just a nice benefit you get as a student)</p>
<h2 id="creating-your-lab-repository">Creating your lab repository</h2>
<p>For each lab assignment, we will provide you with an <em>invitation URL</em> that will allow you sign up for the lab assignment on GitHub, and which will result in the creation of a repository called <code>2020-labN-GITHUB_USERNAME</code> inside our <code>cmsc22000-labs</code> organization on GitHub (a GitHub &ldquo;organization&rdquo; is basically a way to group together related repositories). For example, if your GitHub username is <code>jrandom</code>, your repository will be called <code>2020-lab1-jrandom</code>. This repository will be private, and can only be viewed by you and the CS 220 course staff.</p>
<h2 id="where-should-you-do-this-lab">Where should you do this lab?</h2>
<p>For this lab, we will specifically need you to work on a CS machine, which means you will have to connect remotely to CS environment. You can do this in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using SSH, which will allow you to open a command-line terminal on a CS machine. The CS techstaff provides <a href="https://howto.cs.uchicago.edu/remote_access">detailed instructions</a> on how to do this.</li>
<li>Connecting to a <a href="https://howto.cs.uchicago.edu/techstaff:vdesk">Virtual Desktop</a>. This will show you, on your computer, effectively the exact same desktop you would see if you physically logged into a CSIL machine. However, this option may not work well for low-bandwidth Internet connections.</li>
</ul>
<p>In future labs, there will be more flexibility on where you can do your work, including working locally on your own computer.</p>
<h2 id="initializing-your-repository">Initializing your repository</h2>
<p>You will start by initializing your repository. Like SVN, your repository is hosted on GitHub, but you can create a local copy in your home directory (we will refer to this as your <em>local repository</em>).</p>
<p>Log into <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>. Your lab repository, <code>cmsc22000-labs/2020-labN-GITHUB_USERNAME</code> should appear under &ldquo;Repositories&rdquo;. This will take you to a page where you can browse your repository through GitHub&rsquo;s web interface. However, you haven&rsquo;t initialized your repository yet, so GitHub will provide you with the instructions to initialize your repository. You are going to follow those instructions, but first need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create a directory in your home directory for CMSC 22000. The name and location of this directory is not important, so if you already have a preferred directory structure, you&rsquo;re welcome to use it. Otherwise, we suggest you simply do this:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir cs220
cd cs220
</code></pre></li>
<li>
<p>Inside that folder, create a file called <code>README.md</code> and add your full name to the file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On your repository&rsquo;s GitHub page, right under &ldquo;Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before&rdquo; there is a URL field with two buttons: HTTPS and SSH. Make sure to change this to &ldquo;HTTPS&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, from inside your CMSC 22000 directory, run the commands that appear under &ldquo;&hellip;or create a new repository on the command line&rdquo; <em>except</em> the first one (the one that starts with <code>echo</code>).</p>
<p><em>Note: If any commands asks you to enter a username and password, just enter your GitHub username and password</em> (do not enter your CNetID and password) If you&rsquo;re using two-factor authentication in GitHub, you&rsquo;ll actually have to provide an &ldquo;authentication token&rdquo; instead of your password (you can find instructions on how to do this <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line">here</a>)</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about what each individual command does; we will be seeing what most of these commands do in this lab. However, if you encounter any error messages, please make sure to let us know.</p>
<p>You can verify that your repository was correctly set up by going back to your repository&rsquo;s page on GitHub, you should now see it contains a <code>README.md</code> file. If you click on it, you can see its contents.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-commit">Creating a commit</h2>
<p>If you make changes to your repository, the way to store those changes (and the updated versions of the modified files) is by creating a <em>commit</em>. So, let&rsquo;s start by making some changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit <code>README.md</code> to also include your CNetID</li>
<li>Add a new file called <code>test.txt</code>. This file should contain a single line with the text <code>Hello, world!</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Creating a commit is a two-step process. First, you have to indicate what files you want to include in your commit. Let’s say we want to create a commit that only includes the updated <code>README.md</code> file. We can specify this operation explicitly using the <code>git add</code> command from the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>git add README.md
</code></pre>
<p>This command will not print any output if it is successful.</p>
<p>To create the commit, use the <code>git commit</code> command. This command will take all the files you added with <code>git add</code> and will bundle them into a commit:</p>
<pre><code>git commit -m &quot;Updated README.md&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The text after the <code>-m</code> is a short message that describes the changes you have made since your last commit. Common examples of commit messages might be &ldquo;Finished lab 1&rdquo; or “Implemented insert function for data struct”.</p>
<aside class="admonition warning">
<div class="admonition-icon"></div>
<div class="admonition-content">If you forget the <code>-m</code> parameter, Git will think that you forgot to specify a commit message. It will graciously open up a default editor so that you can enter such a message. This can be useful if you want to enter a longer commit message (including multi-line messages). We will experiment with this later.</div>
</aside>
<p>Once you run the above command, you will see something like the following output:</p>
<pre><code>[master 3e39c15] Updated README.md
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
</code></pre>
<p>You’ve created a commit, but you’re not done yet: you haven’t uploaded it to the server yet. Forgetting this step is actually a very common pitfall, so don’t forget to upload your changes. You must use the <code>git push</code> command for your changes to actually be uploaded to the Git server. <em>If you don’t, the graders will not be able to see your code</em>. Simply run the following command from the Linux command-line:</p>
<pre><code>git push
</code></pre>
<p>You will be asked for your GitHub username and password; once you enter them, you should see something like this output:</p>
<pre><code>Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 274 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/cmsc22000-labs/2020-lab1-borjasotomayor.git
   4885f1c..3e39c15  master -&gt; master
</code></pre>
<p>You can ignore most of those messages. The important thing is to not see any warnings or error messages.</p>
<aside class="admonition warning">
<div class="admonition-icon"></div>
<div class="admonition-content">When you push for the first time, you may get a message saying that <code>push.default is unset</code>, and suggesting two possible commands to remedy the situation. While the rest of the lab will work fine if you don&rsquo;t run either of these commands, you should run the command to use &ldquo;simple&rdquo; (this will prevent the warning from appearing every time you push)</div>
</aside>
<p>You can verify that our Git server correctly received your commit by going to your repository on GitHub. The <code>README.md</code> file should now show the updated content (your name with your CNetID)</p>
<p>In general, if you’re concerned about whether the graders are seeing the right version of your code, you can just go to GitHub. Whatever is shown on your repository&rsquo;s page is what the graders will see. If you wrote some code, and it doesn’t show up on GitHub, make sure you didn’t forget to add your files, create a commit, and push the most recent commit to the server.</p>
<h2 id="git-add-revisited-and-git-status">git add revisited and git status</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make a further change to <code>README.md</code>: Add a line with the text <code>CMSC 22000 - Introduction to Software Development</code>.</p>
<p>So, at this point, we have a file we have already committed (<code>README.md</code>) but where the <em>local</em> version is now out of sync with the version on GitHub. Furthermore, earlier we created a <code>test.txt</code> file. Is it a part of our repository? You can use the following command to ask Git for a summary of the files it is tracking:</p>
<pre><code>git status
</code></pre>
<p>This command should output something like this:</p>
<pre><code>On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)

    test.txt

no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that there are two types of files listed here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Changes not staged for commit</code>: This is a list of files that Git knows about and have been modified since your last commit, but which have not been added to a commit (with <code>git add</code>). Note that we <em>did</em> use <code>git add</code> previously with <code>README.md</code> (which is why Git is &ldquo;tracking&rdquo; that file), but we have not run <code>git add</code> since our last commit, which means the change we made to <code>README.md</code> is not currently going to be included in any commit. Remember: committing is a two-step process (you <code>git add</code> the files that will be part of the commit, and then you create the commit).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Untracked files</code>: This is a list of files that Git has found in the same directory as your repository, but which Git isn&rsquo;t keeping track of.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<aside class="admonition warning">
<div class="admonition-icon"></div>
<div class="admonition-content">You may see some automatically generated files in your Untracked files section. Files that start with a pound sign (#) or end with a tilde should <em>not</em> be added to your repository. Files that end with a tilde are backup files created by some editors that are intended to help you restore your files if your computer crashes. In general, files that are automatically generated should not be committed to your repository. Other people should be able to generate their own versions, if necessary.</div>
</aside>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s go ahead and add <code>README.md</code>:</p>
<pre><code>git add README.md
</code></pre>
<p>And re-run <code>git status</code>. You should see something like this:</p>
<pre><code>On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)

    new file:   README.md

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   test.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how there is now a new category of files: <code>Changes to be committed</code>. Adding <code>README.md</code> not only added the file to your repository, it also staged it into the next commit (which, remember, won’t happen until you actually run <code>git commit</code>).</p>
<p>If we now add <code>test.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>git add test.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The output of <code>git status</code> should now look like this:</p>
<pre><code>On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)

    new file:   README.md
    modified:   test.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we are going to create a commit with these changes. Notice how we are not going to use the <code>-m</code> parameter to <code>git commit</code>:</p>
<pre><code>git commit
</code></pre>
<p>When you omit <code>-m</code>, Git will open a terminal text editor where you can write your commit message, including multiline commit messages. By default, the CS machines will use Vim for this (if you are not a Vim user, you can quit by typing <code>:wq</code>). If you want to change your default command-line editor, add a line like this:</p>
<pre><code>export EDITOR=myfavoriteeditor
</code></pre>
<p>At the end of the <code>.bashrc</code> file in your home directory (make sure you replace <code>myfavoriteeditor</code> with the command for your favorite command-line editor: <code>vi</code>, <code>emacs</code>, <code>nano</code>, <code>mcedit</code>, etc.)</p>
<p>Once Git opens your editor of choice, you will see something like this:</p>
<pre><code># Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
# On branch master
# Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#       new file:   README.md
#       modified:   test.txt
#
</code></pre>
<p>Now, type in the following commit message:</p>
<pre><code>Lab 1 updates:

- Added test.txt
- Updated README.md file
</code></pre>
<p>Then, just save the file and exit (using the appropriate commands in your editor of choice). This will complete the commit, and you will see a message like this:</p>
<pre><code>[master 9119c6f] Lab 1 updates
 2 files changed, 3 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
 create mode 100644 test.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Now, edit both files and add an extra line to each of them with the text <code>Git is pretty cool</code>. Running <code>git status</code> should now show the following:</p>
<pre><code>On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use &quot;git push&quot; to publish your local commits)
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   README.md
    modified:   test.txt
</code></pre>
<p>If we want to create a commit with these changes, we could simply run <code>git add</code> twice (once for each file) but, fortunately, we can also do this:</p>
<pre><code>git add -u
</code></pre>
<p>This will add every file that Git is tracking, and will ignore untracked files. There are a few other shortcuts for adding multiple files, like <code>git add .</code> and <code>git add --all</code>, but we suggest you avoid them, since they can result in adding files you did not intend to add to your repository.</p>
<p>So, if you run <code>git add -u</code> and create a commit:</p>
<pre><code>git commit -m &quot;A few more changes&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><code>git status</code> will now show this:</p>
<pre><code>On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.
  (use &quot;git push&quot; to publish your local commits)
nothing to commit, working directory clean
</code></pre>
<p>The message <code>Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.</code> is telling you that your local repository contains two commits that have not yet been uploaded to GitHub. In fact, if you go to your repository on the GitHub website, you&rsquo;ll see that the two commits we just created are nowhere to be seen. As helpfully pointed out by the above output, all we need to do is run <code>git push</code>, which should show something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Counting objects: 8, done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Writing objects: 100% (8/8), 730 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.

   3e39c15..53462fb  master -&gt; master
</code></pre>
<p>Now go to GitHub. Do you see the updates in your repository? Click on &ldquo;Commits&rdquo; (above the file listing in your repository). If you click on the individual commits, you will be able to see the exact changes that were included in each commit.</p>
<p>Now, <code>git status</code> will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working directory clean
</code></pre>
<p>If you see <code>nothing to commit, working directory clean</code>, that means that there are no changes in your local repository since the last commit you created (and, additionally, the above output also tells us that all our commits have also been uploaded to GitHub)</p>
<h2 id="working-from-multiple-locations">Working from multiple locations</h2>
<p>So far, you have a local repository in your CS home directory, which you have been uploading to GitHub using the <code>git push</code> command. However, if you work from multiple locations (e.g., on a CS machine but also from your laptop), you will need to be able to create a local repository in those locations too. You can do this by running the <code>git clone</code> command (don&rsquo;t run this command just yet):</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/cmsc22000-labs/2020-lab1-username.git
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a local repository that &ldquo;clones&rdquo; the version of the repository that is currently stored on GitHub. Let&rsquo;s do this in a different directory on the machine you are on. For example:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p /tmp/$USER/cs220
cd /tmp/$USER/cs220
git clone https://github.com/cmsc22000-labs/2020-lab1-username.git
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure to replace <code>username</code> with your GitHub username!</p>
<p>Take into account that, when you run <code>git clone</code>, the repository is not cloned <em>into</em> the current directory. Instead, a <em>new</em> directory (with the same name as the repository) will be created in the current directory, and you will need to <code>cd</code> into it to use Git commands for that repository.</p>
<p>Now, in the local repository in your home directory, add a line to <code>test.txt</code> with the text <code>One more change!</code>. Create a commit for that change and push it to GitHub (you should know how to do this by now, but make sure to  <a href="/cmsc22000/labs/help/">ask for help</a> if you&rsquo;re unsure of how to proceed).</p>
<p>Next, in the <em>second</em> local repository (the one you just created in a separate location in the machine you&rsquo;re working on), check if that change appears in the <code>test.txt</code> file. It will not, because you have not yet downloaded the latest commits from the repository. You can do this by running this:</p>
<pre><code>git pull
</code></pre>
<p>This should output something like this:</p>
<pre><code>remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.

<p>If you have multiple local repositories (e.g., one on a CS machine and one on your laptop), it is very important that you remember to run <code>git pull</code> before you start working, and that you <code>git push</code> any changes you make. Otherwise, your local repositories (and the repository on GitHub) may <em>diverge</em> leading to a messy situation called a <em>merge conflict</em> (we will be exploring these in a future Git lab). This will be specially important once you start using Git for its intended purpose: to collaborate with multiple developers, where each developer will have their own local repository, and it will become easier for some developers&rsquo; code to diverge from others&rsquo;.</p>
<h2 id="discarding-changes-and-unstaging">Discarding changes and unstaging</h2>
<p>One of the benefits of using a version control system is that it is very easy to inspect the history of changes to a given file, as well as to undo changes we did not intend to make. For example, edit <code>test.txt</code> to remove all its contents. <code>git status</code> will tell us this:</p>
<pre><code>On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   test.txt

no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>If we want to discard the changes we made to <code>test.txt</code>, all we have to do is follow the helpful advice provided by the above output:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -- test.txt
</code></pre>
<p>If you open <code>test.txt</code>, you&rsquo;ll see that its contents have been magically restored!</p>
<p>Now, edit <code>test.txt</code> and <code>README.md</code> to add an additional line with the text <code>Hopefully our last change...</code>. Run <code>git add -u</code> but don&rsquo;t commit it just yet. <code>git status</code> will show this:</p>
<pre><code>On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)

    modified:   README.md
    modified:   test.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s say we realized we want to commit the changes to <code>README.md</code>, but not to <code>test.txt</code>. However, we&rsquo;ve already told git that we want to include <code>test.txt</code> in the commit. Fortunately, we can &ldquo;un-include&rdquo; it (or &ldquo;unstage&rdquo; it, in Git lingo) by running this:</p>
<pre><code>git reset HEAD test.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Now, <code>git status</code> will show the following:</p>
<pre><code>On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)

    modified:   README.md

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   test.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Go ahead and run <code>git commit</code>. The commit will now include only <code>README.md</code>.</p>
<h2 id="looking-at-the-commit-log">Looking at the commit log</h2>
<p>Once you have made multiple commits, you can see these commits, their dates, commit messages, author, etc. by typing <code>git log</code>. This command will open a scrollable interface (using the up/down arrow keys) that you can get out of by pressing the <code>q</code> key. As we saw earlier, you can also see the history of commits through on GitHub&rsquo;s web interface, but it is also useful to be able to access the commit log directly from the terminal, without having to open a browser.</p>
<p>Each commit will have a <em>commit hash</em> (usually referred to as the <em>commit SHA</em>) that looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>9119c6ffcebc2e3540d587180236aaf1222ee63c
</code></pre>
<p>This is a unique identifier that we can use to refer to that commit elsewhere. For example, choose any commit from the commit log and run the following:</p>
<pre><code>git show COMMIT_SHA
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure to replace <code>COMMIT_SHA</code> with a commit SHA that appears in your commit log.</p>
<p>This will show you the changes that were included in that commit. The output of <code>git show</code> can be a bit hard to parse at first but the most important thing to take into account is that any line starting with a <code>+</code> denotes a line that was added, and any line starting with a <code>-</code> denotes a line that was removed.</p>
<p>Pro tip: in any place where you have to refer to a commit SHA, you can just write the first few characters of the commit SHA. For example, for commit <code>9119c6ffcebc2e3540d587180236aaf1222ee63c</code> we could write just this:</p>
<pre><code>git show 9119c6f
</code></pre>
<p>Git will only complain if there is more than one commit that starts with that same prefix.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve completed all the steps described above, congratulations, you&rsquo;ve already earned 40 points (out of 100) in this lab! Make sure you remember to <code>git push</code> so the grader can verify you completed all the above tasks. Please note that the above tasks will be graded as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task 1</strong>: 10 points for the <code>Updated README.md</code> commit</li>
<li><strong>Task 2</strong>: 5 points for the <code>Lab 1 updates</code> commit</li>
<li><strong>Task 3</strong>: 5 points for the <code>A few more changes</code> commit</li>
<li><strong>Task 4</strong>: 10 points for the commit for testing that git pull works correctly</li>
<li><strong>Task 5</strong>: 10 points for the commit with <code>README.md</code> (after unstaging <code>test.txt</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Before this lab&rsquo;s deadline, you must also complete the tasks below. Some of them can be done just with what you have learned in this lab, but most of them will require that you find the exact Git command (or series of Git commands) on your own. This is a very useful skill to develop: most software developers never take a course on Git or read a full book on Git before starting to use it; they learn the basics (like you did in this lab), and then rely on online documentation to fill the gaps.</p>
<p>So, for the following tasks, you are allowed to obtain the answers in any way you want <strong>EXCEPT</strong> by asking someone (other than a CS 220 instructor or TA) to help you. This means you cannot ask for hints, solutions, pointers to documentation, etc. from <em>anyone</em> (classmates, roommates, friends, parents, etc.). There is one exception, though: if someone asks a question on the <code>#course-labs</code> channel on Slack, you are allowed to help them out there, as long as you don&rsquo;t provide them with the answer (however, you are allowed to provide them with links to resources they may find useful to figure out the task). See our <a href="/cmsc22000/labs/help/">Getting Help</a> page for more details on the <code>#course-labs</code> channel.</p>
<p>Please note that you are welcome to take the answer verbatim from a website, online reference, online forum, etc. as long as you provide <em>attribution</em> (i.e., you need to tell us where you found the answer). Of course, you must also follow the instructions you find in those references to complete the task you&rsquo;ve been given.</p>
<p>Pro tip: Sometimes, just Googling for &ldquo;how do I&hellip;&rdquo; will yield the answer or, at least, some solid leads.</p>
<h4 id="task-6">Task 6</h4>
<p>(10 points) Create a directory <code>lab1</code> in your repository containing a file called <code>README.md</code> containing your name and CNetID. Add, commit, and push that file.</p>
<p>Create a file called <code>tasks.txt</code> in your <code>lab1</code> directory. Most of the following tasks will require that you add something to this file, so we can verify that you completed a task correctly. Don&rsquo;t add the file just yet.</p>
<p>Note: In all subsequent tasks, you should work only with the files inside the <code>lab1</code> directory.</p>
<h4 id="task-7">Task 7</h4>
<p>(5 points) Add the following in <code>tasks.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Task 7
------
</code></pre>
<p>Create a commit for this change with commit message <code>Addeing Task 8</code> (yes, exactly that commit message) but make sure you <em>don&rsquo;t push it</em>.</p>
<p>Wait! What an embarrassing typo! Find out how you can edit the commit message of an existing commit (i.e., the solution is not to create a new commit; you have to find out how to edit the commit message of the commit you just created). Update the commit message to be &ldquo;Adding Task 7&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Edit <code>tasks.txt</code> to explain how you updated the commit message (feel free to simply copy-paste the command you ran and its output). Make sure to explain how you found out the answer to this questions! (including citing any relevant sources). When you&rsquo;re done editing <code>tasks.txt</code>, make sure to add, commit and push your changes.</p>
<h4 id="task-8">Task 8</h4>
<p>(5 points) At this point, you&rsquo;re probably getting tired of always having to enter your GitHub password whenever you run certain Git commands. Figure out a way to not have to enter your password every time, and edit the <code>tasks.txt</code> file to explain what you did (copy-pasting the command(s) you ran and their output is also enough)</p>
<p>Hint: There is basically a way to tell Git to remember your password. That is the simplest way to accomplish this, but there&rsquo;s also a (slightly more complicated) way involving &ldquo;SSH keys&rdquo;. Unless you already know about SSH keys, you may want to skip that mechanism for now, and revisit it at a later time.</p>
<h4 id="task-9">Task 9</h4>
<p>(5 points) Take a look at the following project on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">https://github.com/junegunn/fzf</a>. All you need to know about this project is that it provides a very handy tool called <code>fzf</code> that is run from the terminal, and which can take some number of command-line arguments.</p>
<p>Clone this repository on your machine, but make sure you clone it in a directory <em>outside</em> the local repository you&rsquo;ve been using so far in this lab. Then, find the exact commit where the authors of this project added a <code>--no-mouse</code> option to the <code>fzf</code> command (hint: commit messages will usually mention when a new feature is added, and this project is no exception).</p>
<p>Take into account that, while you should be able to find this out using only Git commands, you may need to find out a convenient way of exploring the commit log (instead of just scrolling endlessly until you find some mention of the <code>--no-mouse</code> option). Include the commit SHA and commit message in <code>tasks.txt</code>, and explain how you located that commit.</p>
<aside class="admonition warning">
<div class="admonition-icon"></div>
<div class="admonition-content">You should ignore any Git instructions provided in the <code>fzf</code> documentation (specially in their <code>README</code> file). These will lead you down the wrong path.</div>
</aside>
<h4 id="task-10">Task 10</h4>
<p>(5 point) Edit <code>README.md</code> (in your repository, not in the <code>fzf</code> repository you just cloned) and add any content to the file. Figure out how you can get Git to tell you the changes you&rsquo;ve made to the file relative to the latest commit. Note that this is different from using <code>git show</code>, as we have not yet committed these changes. Once you have figured this out, and updated <code>tasks.txt</code> accordingly, undo these changes using <code>git checkout</code>.</p>
<h4 id="task-11">Task 11</h4>
<p>(5 points) Create a file called <code>mistake.txt</code> with any content. Add, commit, and push it to your repository.</p>
<p>Actually, adding that file was a mistake (duh!). Figure out how to remove that file from your repository, while keeping a record of the fact that the file existed at some point. In other words, we are not asking you to <em>undo</em> the commit that created the file. We&rsquo;re asking you to create a commit that will remove the file. Explain in <code>tasks.txt</code> how you did this.</p>
<p>Note: The next task asks you to do something similar, and this task can technically be accomplished using the same (more general) mechanism in Task 12. For this task, you should find a command that specifically allows you to remove files.</p>
<h4 id="task-12">Task 12</h4>
<p>(10 points) Edit <code>README.md</code> to add the text <code>This is a mistake</code>. Add and commit (but do not push) this change. Edit the file again to add the test <code>This is also a mistake</code>. Add and commit (but do not push) this change.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s say we want to remove those two changes. We could, of course, just edit the file again, remove those lines, and add/commit the updated file (the commit could have a message like <code>Reverting changes from commits A and B</code>). However, if those two commits contained a large number of changes, removing those changes manually could get really messy. Fortunately, Git provides a command that will take one or more commits, and create a new commit with the opposite changes from those commits (effectively undoing those commits)</p>
<p>Note: You may encounter instructions online on how to &ldquo;undo&rdquo; a commit (in the sense of completely removing it from the commit log). This is not what we&rsquo;re asking you to do: you must find a command that specifically takes one or more commits, and undoes them by creating a new commit (thus preserving the record of those original commits).</p>
<h4 id="task-13">Task 13</h4>
<p>(15 points) In many software projects, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for bugs to go unnoticed for a long time, until someone happens to run the software in a way that makes the bug apparent. At that point, it&rsquo;s often your responsibility to find the commit that introduced the bad behavior. On the flipside, it&rsquo;s also common to want to find the commit that introduced new good behavior, for example, in issue discussions (e.g. &ldquo;This request is redundant because that new behavior was already introduced in commit c4b17f9&hellip;&quot;). Git provides an extremely powerful command for doing exactly this! (we will cryptically refer to this command as &ldquo;command X&rdquo;) In this task, you must find this command and then use it to track down where a bug was fixed in an existing repository.</p>
<p>bcal (found here <a href="https://github.com/jarun/bcal">https://github.com/jarun/bcal</a>) is a nifty little utility for doing byte arithmetic and unit conversions (e.g. &ldquo;how much is 5MB in MiB?&rdquo; &ldquo;what’s 5KB*1GB?&quot;). In the old days of bcal, it had a bug in its parser that would cause the following expression to fail to evaluate:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./bcal &quot;5*5*5mb&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Clone the bcal repository into a new directory, and use command X to find the exact commit that fixed this behavior. You can run the bcal command like so:</p>
<pre><code>$ make
$ ./bcal &quot;5*5*5mb&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>In <code>tasks.txt</code>, add a few sentences explaining how you found the desired commit, and a line with the commit SHA (the hash identifier of the commit) as well as its text. There is one and only one right answer to this task, and there is one and only one git command that we will consider correct. We will only give you the following hints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Command X is not any of the commands we have shown in this lab, nor any of the commands you were asked to find in previous tasks. In particular, you cannot solve this task just by using <code>git log</code> to inspect the commit log of the bcal project.</li>
<li>Command X has to be run multiple times (with different options/parameters) to solve this task.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be graded partially on discovering the identity of command X, and partially on using command X to find the commit where the bcal bug was fixed.</p>
<h3 id="submitting-your-lab">Submitting your lab</h3>
<p>Before submitting, make sure you&rsquo;ve committed and pushed your changes to the <code>tasks.txt</code> file (remember you can run <code>git status</code> to check this).</p>
<p>Additionally, to make it easier for the graders to check your answers to Tasks 7-13, you will be copy-pasting your answers to those tasks (i.e., whatever you wrote for those tasks in the <code>tasks.txt</code> file) on <a href="https://gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a>. If you have never used Gradescope before, it is a web-based assignment submission and grading system. You can access Lab #1 either by logging into <a href="https://gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a> or via Canvas.</p>
<p>Once in Gradescope, simply select assignment &ldquo;Lab #1: Git&rdquo;, and fill in the answers for Tasks 7-12. Please note that you will not be able to enter any answers for Tasks 1-6 on Gradescope, since those will be based on the graders&rsquo; inspection of your GitHub repository (but we still need to include those tasks on Gradescope so we can grade them as part of this lab).</p>
