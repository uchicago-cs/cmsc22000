<h2>Course Description<a class="headerlink" href="#course-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Developing a software system (e.g., an application, a web server, an
operating system, etc.) requires much more than just knowing how to
program. Software development encompasses multiple activities, such as
systems design, implementation, testing, debugging, deployment,
documentation, and maintenance, all weaved together by following a
specific methodology. Not just that, software development is a highly
collaborative activity, where certain skills, like effective
communication and the ability to give/receive feedback, can be key to
the success of a software project.</p>
<p>This class bridges the gap between knowing how to program and knowing
how to develop software: it is intended for students who have recently
completed CMSC 15200 Introduction to Computer Science 2 or CMSC 16200
Honors Introduction to Computer Science 2, and will cover fundamental
concepts and skills in software development, providing a solid
foundation before students move on to majors-level classes that require
developing complex software systems. The class will cover foundational
topics in software development in lectures, but will also include
hands-on homeworks, guest lectures from industry speakers, and a
collaborative quarter-long project, where the entire class, divided into
teams with specific responsibilities, will work on developing new
features for an existing software system.</p>
<p>In this course, students will learn how to…</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>… follow a software development process/methodology to manage the
life cycle of a software system.</p></li>
<li><p>… use tools that support the software development process (e.g.,
build systems, testing frameworks, debuggers, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>… develop software collaboratively through (a) the use of tools,
systems, and best practices available to facilitate that
collaboration (e.g., version control systems, code reviews, task
tracking, etc.), and (b) exercising collaborative skills
(communication, giving/accepting feedback, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="prerequisites">
<h3>Prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#prerequisites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Students must have taken CMSC 15200 or CMSC 16200.</p>
<p>In Spring 2021, students will have to apply to participate in this
class, and only students who took CMSC 15200 or CMSC 16200 in Spring
2020, Summer 2020, Autumn 2020, or Winter 2021 will be invited to apply
(<em>absolutely no exceptions will be made</em>).</p>
<p>Please note that CMSC 15400 is <em>not</em> a prerequisite for this class.
Students who are taking CMSC 15200/16200 in Winter 2021, and who end up
taking CMSC 22000, are strongly encouraged to defer CMSC 15400 until the
Fall, instead of taking CMSC 22000 and CMSC 15400 concurrently.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="course-organization">
<h2>Course Organization<a class="headerlink" href="#course-organization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This class will be run online, with no in-person components.</p>
<p>Most of the course content will be delivered via pre-recorded lectures,
but please note that the whole class will still meet synchronously via
Zoom at the following times:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Mondays 3pm-3:50pm</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Weeks 1-2: Lecture</p></li>
<li><p>Weeks 3-9: Project All-Hands Meeting</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fridays 3pm-3:50pm</strong>: Discussion/Q&amp;A</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above meetings will be recorded for students who are unable
to attend.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have time reserved on Mondays 4:30pm-5:50pm for project
teams meetings (this is listed as a “lab” on the Registrar’s site, but
please note that it is not a traditional lab session).
Team meetings will start on Week 3, and each team will be assigned a 30 minute
slot between 4:30pm-5:50pm to meet with a TA.</p>
<p>We may also schedule a series of optional discussions and guest talks
on Wednesdays from 3pm to 3:50pm.</p>
<p>A large part of the class will revolve around the development of a
software project where students will be able to apply many of the
concepts covered in the lectures (this project is described in more
detail in the “Course Project” section below). In this project, the
entire class will work on the same code (through a public GitHub
repository visible to the entire class). Students will be divided into
teams of 4-5 students, and each team will work on a specific aspect of
the project. In each team, a TA will act as the senior developer in the
team. Students will be assessed both on their performance as a team, as
well as on their performance on individual tasks assigned to them in
their teams.</p>
<p>During the first two weeks of the quarter, the class will focus on
covering core concepts regarding the software development process.
Starting in week 3, the focus of the class will shift towards the
development of the course project, with Mondays used for a project
all-hands meeting, and each team having a 30-minute meeting with the
team’s senior developer during lab hours.</p>
<p>For a complete schedule of lectures and other milestones, please see
the <a class="reference external" href="calendar.html">Course Calendar</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="homework">
<h3>Homework<a class="headerlink" href="#homework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Weekly homework assignments will supplement the material covered in lectures, and
will allow students to learn and practice skills that will be necessary
in the course project. These assignments must be completed individually.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project">
<h3>Project<a class="headerlink" href="#project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The course project revolves around developing a complex software system.
The scope and complexity of this project will require that the entire
class work together towards developing a fully-featured software
product.</p>
<p>More specifically, the entire class will be working on the same
codebase. The class will be divided into teams of 4-5 students, with an
undergraduate TA acting as a “senior developer” in each of these teams
(TAs will be students who have previously taken CMSC 22000 and/or who
have prior industry experience via internships). Teams will be arranged
by the instructor/TAs (they will not be self-selecting).</p>
<p>During Weeks 2-3, the teams will work on a warmup exercise on software
design. A design exercise will be assigned in Week 2 (due Week 3), and a
follow-up exercise will be assigned in Week 3 (due Week 4). Teams will
get feedback on their first exercise before the second one is due, and
there will be a Zoom session in Week 3 dedicated to discussing the
design exercise.</p>
<p>Starting in Week 3, project planning will follow a Scrum-like process,
with weeks 3-9 of the quarter being divided into several sprints.
Starting on Week 3, all teams have an all-hands meeting during Monday
class hours, and each team will have an additional team meeting during
the lab section of the class. Teams will keep track of their tasks
through GitHub issues, with grading primarily based on their performance
on these tasks.</p>
<p>More details on the project can be found on the <a class="reference external" href="project/index.html">Project</a> page.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lecture-quizzes">
<h3>Lecture Quizzes<a class="headerlink" href="#lecture-quizzes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The pre-recorded lectures will include very simple quizzes that should
be trivial to pass if you pay attention to the videos. The goal of these
quizzes is to reward students who watch the pre-recorded lectures in a
timely manner, and who pay attention while watching the videos.</p>
<p>To earn the points for a quiz, you must complete the quiz no later than
one week after the lecture is posted. Furthermore, if your total score
on the quizzes (for the entire quarter) is above 75%, you will get 100%
of the points allocated to the lecture quizzes on your final grade. If
your total score on the quizzes is below below 75%, you will be awarded
a proportional amount of the points.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="books">
<h2>Books<a class="headerlink" href="#books" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While this class does not have a required textbook, most of the Software
Engineering content draws heavily from Ian Sommerville’s book, <a class="reference external" href="http://iansommerville.com/software-engineering-book/">Software
Engineering</a>.
The Software Design content also draws heavily from John Ousterhout’s
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201">A Philosophy of Software Design</a>.</p>
<p>Please see the <a class="reference external" href="resources/other.html">Other Resources</a> page for a
number of other books and online resources covering much of the material
in this class.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grading">
<h2>Grading<a class="headerlink" href="#grading" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Grading is based on the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>25% Homework Assignments (each homework weighed equally)</p></li>
<li><p>5% Lecture Quizzes</p></li>
<li><p>70% Project, divided into:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>5% Team Design Exercise</p></li>
<li><p>35% Individual Evaluation</p></li>
<li><p>15% Team Evaluation</p></li>
<li><p>5% Peer Feedback</p></li>
<li><p>10% Final Presentation</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a class="reference external" href="project/policies.html">Project Policies</a> page for more details
on how the project scores are determined.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are 2 points of extra credit that are unlocked by
completing a final goal in the course project (this goal is such that it
can only be reached if all teams have substantially completed and
integrated their work for the project). If these extra points are
unlocked, they are awarded to everyone in the class.</p>
<p>Grades are not curved in this class or, at least, not in the traditional
sense. We use a standard set of grade boundaries:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>95-100: A</p></li>
<li><p>90-95: A-</p></li>
<li><p>85-90: B+</p></li>
<li><p>80-85: B</p></li>
<li><p>75-80: B-</p></li>
<li><p>70-75: C+</p></li>
<li><p>&lt; 70: Dealt on a case-by-case basis</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We curve only to the extent that we may lower the boundaries for one or
more letter grades, depending on the distribution of the raw scores.</p>
<div class="section" id="homework-regrades">
<h3>Homework Regrades<a class="headerlink" href="#homework-regrades" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We sometimes make mistakes, and are happy to review any incorrect grading decision.</p>
<p>However, please note that we will only consider regrade requests where a grader made an
actual mistake (e.g., they took points off claiming you didn’t do something,
when you actually did do it and the grader maybe missed that when reading over
your submission). We will not consider regrade requests that ask for point
penalties to be reduced, or try to argue that we should not be taking points off
for a given issue in your code.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you receive a penalty that says
“-2 points: Function X did not check that parameter Y is greater than zero”.
If function X in your code <em>did</em> perform this check, and the grader
missed this fact (and erroneously applied that penalty), you can submit
a regrade request asking us to review this decision. We ask that you keep
these requests brief and to the point: no more than 1-2 paragraphs identifying
the exact penalty and the reasons you believe it was applied erroneously, including
references to specific parts of your code (e.g., “I did check the value of the
parameter in line 107”). Focus on laying out the facts, and nothing else.</p>
<p>On the other hand, let’s say you received the “Function X did not check that
parameter Y is greater than zero” penalty, and function X in your code did <em>not</em> perform this check. In this case, you cannot submit
a regrade request arguing that this is not something for which we should deduct
points, or that the point deduction should be lower. Please note that all penalties
are explicitly approved by an instructor (graders have no discretion to come up with
penalties on their own and, if they took points off for something, it is because they
were directed to do so by an instructor).</p>
<p>Please note that, while you may request a regrade for a specific issue,
an instructor may do a full regrade of your submission if they feel there
are other issues with the grading of your submission. This can result in you
ending up with a lower score on the assignment.</p>
<p>Finally, it is also your responsibility to make
these requests in a timely manner. Requests for regrades must be submitted
no later than <strong>one week</strong> after a graded piece of work is returned to you.
After that time, we will not consider any requests for regrades,
<em>regardless of whether the regrade request is reasonable and justified</em>.</p>

<div class="section" id="policies">
<h2>Policies<a class="headerlink" href="#policies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="policy-on-academic-honesty">
<h3>Policy on academic honesty<a class="headerlink" href="#policy-on-academic-honesty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We take academic honesty very seriously in this class. Please make sure to
read our <a class="reference external" href="academic_honesty.html">Academic Honesty</a> page. Please note that
this policy applies primarily to the homework assignments,
which must be completed individually.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the project is structured
in such a way that you can collaborate and share code with anyone in the class,
and even use code you find on the Internet. However,
this can lead to a number of gray areas where it may be hard to tell if
your work is academically honest.</p>
<p>For example, the following are activities that may be considered academically
dishonest in other contexts, but are acceptable in the project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Taking a snippet of code you find on Stack Overflow (as long as you provide attribution)</p></li>
<li><p>Adding a large piece of code not written by yourself (e.g., a third-party library), as long as you
provide attribution and your use of that code does not violate the terms of a software license.</p></li>
<li><p>Asking someone outside the class for help with writing your code, as long as you credit
them somewhere.</p></li>
<li><p>Posting on online forums for help with figuring out a issue with your code (we would prefer
that you ask those questions directly to us but, to be clear, using external forums in this way
is not forbidden).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, we will not be policing the attribution of small-scale contributions by outside
sources, but it is still important that you include those attributions from a documentation
perspective.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the following are examples of behaviour that would be considered
academically dishonest in the project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Having someone outside the class do your assigned tasks in the project (as opposed to
just getting assistance from them)</p></li>
<li><p>Taking credit for work that someone else in the class did. Please note that there are many situations
where students will legitimately <em>share</em> credit for a piece of work, and jointly earn points for it;
what would be unacceptable would be to falsely take sole credit for work you did not do,
as a way to earn extra points for that work.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are ever concerned that you may be doing something that could be considered academically
dishonest, please don’t hesitate to ask us for clarification. We are always happy to answer
these kind of questions.</p>

<div class="section" id="ta-grader-code-of-conduct">
<h3>TA/Grader Code of Conduct<a class="headerlink" href="#ta-grader-code-of-conduct" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This class has an explicit <a class="reference external" href="code_of_conduct.html">code of conduct</a> that TAs and graders must abide by.</p>
<p>This code of conduct exists not because we expect bad behavior from our staff, but because we believe a clear code of conduct is an important piece in creating inclusive spaces, particularly in CS. We share this code of conduct with you (the students) so you know the expectations we have set for our TAs and graders.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="zoom-guidelines">
<h3>Zoom guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#zoom-guidelines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We will be using Zoom in this class. We expect your interactions via Zoom to be consistent with an in-person class experience. Respect the people you’re working with. Enter the Zoom meetings muted if possible (unfortunately, it will not be possible if you’re calling in), and unmute to speak. Raise your hand if you’d like to speak. [There’s a “Raise Hand” button on the participant page.] If your background is unusually noisy, use the chat channel instead of unmuting. We strongly encourage you to have your camera on during our Zoom sessions, but we’ll understand if some of you prefer to keep your video off.</p>
<p>Note that you can set your name in your Zoom profile, so you don’t have to go with whatever was assigned. We encourage you to include your pronouns in your name (if so, please include them after your last name).</p>
<p>Our Zoom class meetings will be recorded and saved to the cloud to allow students in this class to review the discussion, and especially to allow students who can’t participate the opportunity to benefit from class. We will not make these recordings available to anyone but class participants, we will not make them available after the quarter, and students will not be allowed to save copies. However, we have no way to guarantee that students will follow this policy. If you have FERPA concerns, please mask yourself accordingly, e.g., by turning off video and using an alias.</p>

<h3>Diversity statement<a class="headerlink" href="#diversity-statement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The University of Chicago is committed to diversity and rigorous inquiry that arises from multiple
perspectives. We concur with that commitment and also believe that we have the highest quality
interactions and can creatively solve more problems when we recognize and share our diversity. We thus
expect to maintain a productive learning environment based upon open communication, mutual respect,
and non-discrimination. We view the diversity that students bring to this class as a resource, strength and
benefit. It is our intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
sexuality, disability, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, religious background, and immigration status.
Any suggestions as to how to further such a positive and open environment in the class will be
appreciated and given serious consideration.</p>
