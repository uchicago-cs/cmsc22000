      <description>You have recently joined a software company that is developing an exciting new game: The Boardmaster 3000! This game will allow users to play a variety of two-player board games, all of which can be played on a square chessboard (like chess, checkers, and some variants of chess) However, we are following an incremental software development model, so we are going to start by supporting only chess. This will give us a chance to get some initial feedback on the Boardmaster 3000 before we move on to supporting other games.</description>
