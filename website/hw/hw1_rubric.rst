Homework 1 Rubric
=================

The grading of this project follows a specifications grading approach. If you have not already
done so, make sure to read our `Grading <../grading.html>`__ page for more details.

When grading your work, we will be checking for completeness (i.e., how much of the
homework you completed) and for quality (whether you completed the exercises in
the homework correctly).

Completeness
------------

The graders will be checking your GitHub repository to verify whether you completed the steps
described in Parts I and Parts II of the homework. They will expect your commits to look roughly like this:

**Part I**

- ``first commit``
- ``Updated README.md``
- ``Homework 1 updates:``

  ``- Added test.txt``

  ``- Updated README.md file``

- ``A few more changes``
- ``Adding one more change``
- ``Our last change?``
- ``Wrapping up first part of the homework``

**Part II**

- ``Added echo.c``
- ``Updated author in echo.c``
- ``Updated buffer size to 1000``
- ``Updated buffer size to 250``
- ``Merge branch 'update-buffer-size' into main``

Please note that this is not a strict list of commits: if you made a mistake at some point,
and had to create additional commit messages because of it, you will not be penalized as long
as it's clear that you were, overall, following the instructions in Parts I and II. On the other hand,
if your list of commits looks like the ones above, that's a pretty good indicator that you're
in good shape (note: the graders will still be looking at the contents of the commits to
verify that you actually performed the steps in the homework, as opposed to just creating a bunch
of commits with the expected titles)

The graders will also check whether you've provided answers for the exercises in Part III.

You will earn, at least, the following ESNU score depending on how much work you completed:

- Satisfactory: Followed the instructions for Parts I and II mostly correctly, and submitted work for Part III
  (regardless of whether that work is correct, as long as it constitutes a good-faith effort to complete
  Part III).
- Needs Improvement: Submitted work for at least one part of the homework.
- Ungradable: Submitted no work (or none of the work constitutes a good-faith effort to complete the homework)


Quality
-------

Amswering most of the Part III exercises correctly will bump you from an N to an S,
or from an S to an E. To do this, your submission can only have at most three of the following issues in Part III:

- Exercise 1: Did not identify the correct git command
- Exercise 1: Did not explain how they found the answer (regardless of whether they identified the correct command)
- Exercise 1: Didn't actually run the command to update the commit.
- Exercise 2: Did not identify the correct commit
- Exercise 2: Did not explain how they found the commit  (regardless of whether they identified the correct command)
- Exercise 3: Did not identify the correct git command
- Exercise 4: Did not identify the correct git command
- Exercise 5: Did not identify the correct git command
- Exercise 5: Did not actually undo the changes (regardless of whether they used the correct command)
