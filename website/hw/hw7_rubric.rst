Homework 7 Rubric
=================

The grading of this project follows a specifications grading approach. If you have not already
done so, make sure to read our `Grading <../grading.html>`__ page for more details.

When grading your work, the graders will be checking for the following issues in your code. Please
note that some of the issues are labelled as "[Major]" (these will have a greater effect on your score
for the homework)

Tasks 1 and 2
-------------

- [Major] HelloApp cannot be found at ``https://CNETID-cs220-hw7.herokuapp.com``
- Did not make a "Broke the Internet!" commit that "breaks" the app.

Task 3
------

- [Major] Did not write a GitHub Actions workflow file, or added a workflow file
  that does not carry out the specified steps.
- The workflow works, but contains steps from Homework 6 that are unnecessary
  in this homework.
- The workflow fails for any reason other than the tests failing.

Task 4
------

- Did not provide a workflow that successfully deploys to Heroku
- Did not provide a workflow where the tests fail, preventing the deployment to Heroku from happening.

The ESNU score will be determined as follows:

- Excellent: No major issues, and at most one other issue.
- Satisfactory: No major issues, and at most two other issues.
- Needs Improvement: At least one major issue, or at least three other issues.
