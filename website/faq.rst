**Why does CMSC 22000 have only CMSC 14200 as a prerequisite, and not CMSC 15200 or CMSC 16200?**

CMSC 22000 is undergoing a major redesign in Autumn 2023 to switch over all the coursework to Python, and we will also be assuming that students have covered a number of software engineering concepts that are now covered in CMSC 14200 (and which were previously covered in the old version of CMSC 22000, but not in the 150s/160s sequence).

**I heard I can only take CMSC 22000 if I have recently finished CMSC 14200, and that I won't be able to take it if more that a year passes since I took CMSC 14200. Is that so?**

That was true in the previous incarnation of CMSC 22000, where students could only register for CMSC 22000 within one year of taking CMSC 15200 or CMSC 16200. This requirement no longer exists, and you can take CMSC 22000 in any year. That said, the class is still designed for students who recently completed CMSC 14200, and may not be as useful to students who are farther along in the CS major.

**Can I take CMSC 22000 if I took CMSC 15200 or CMSC 16200?**

After students who took CMSC 14200 have had a chance to register for the class, we may have spots available for students who took the CS 150s/160s sequence. Please reach out to Prof. Sotomayor no earlier than the week before classes start to see if any spots are available.

Also, please bear in mind that students who took CMSC 15200 or CMSC 16200 will have to do a substantial amount of self-study to cover the software development material that is currently being covered in CMSC 14200. You must also already be fluent in Python coming into the class.
