Project
=======

In the course project, you will be divided into teams of five students,
and will work collaboratively (both within your team and between teams)
to create a complex software system that will involve designing and
implementing a number of components. You will be using several tools to
support the collaborative aspects of this project and, indeed, your
collaborative skills will be as important as your coding skills to be
successful in this project.

The following pages provide more details on the requirements of the
project:

-  `chiventure: a Text Adventure Game Engine <chiventure.html>`__: The project you will be implementing
-  `Project Policies <policies.html>`__: A detailed
   description of how the project is structured, how you will be
   evaluated, etc.
-  `Features <features.html>`__: The features that teams can
   be assigned to work on.

Additionally, the course project also involves two warm-up exercises
that you will do with your teams, and which revolve around software
design. These two exercises will be posted in Weeks 2 and 3, respectively.
