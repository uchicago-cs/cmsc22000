Project Policies
================

.. note::

   We are currently updating the grading scheme for this class, which will result in a number
   of updates to the project policies. That said, we expect the project's coursework
   to remain largely the same (what will change is the way in which that coursework
   is graded, and how your final grade is computed based on that work)

Project Organization
--------------------

In this project, you will be divided into teams of five students, and
will work collaboratively (both within your team and between teams) on a
complex software system, `chiventure <chiventure.html>`__, that will
involve improving existing code as well as designing and
implementing new functionality. You will be using several tools to
support the collaborative aspects of this project and, indeed, your
collaborative skills will be as important as your coding skills to be
successful in this project. The project will follow an agile process
that resembles (but does not exactly follow)
`Scrum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)>`__.

Each team will be assigned to work on `an existing or new feature of chiventure <features.html>`__ (teams will have a
chance to express a preference, although we can’t guarantee we’ll be
able to assign each team to their preferred feature). In each team, a TA
will act as Senior Developer.

Project Timeline
----------------

The project will span seven weeks (Weeks 3 - 9), with a final review and
team presentations taking place during Finals Week. The seven weeks of
the project will be divided into a project kick-off and four sprints,
with sprint reviews happening on Mondays.

-  Week 3: Project kick-off. This week will be primarily used for you to
   familiarize yourself with project and the exact work your team will
   do.
-  Week 4: Sprint 1
-  Week 5: Sprint 2.
-  Weeks 6-7: Sprint 3
-  Weeks 8-9: Sprint 4

Project Evaluation
------------------

The project is worth 70% of your final grade, and these 70 points are
divided as follows:

-  5: Team Design Exercise
-  35: Your individual score on the project
-  15: Your team score (the average of all the individual scores on a
   team)
-  5: Peer feedback
-  10: Final presentation during Finals Week.

Unlike a traditional programming assignment or project, the exact final
outcome of the project is not known in advance. Of course, we will set
some high-level goals and requirements and, while those requirements
will help us measure whether the project is “done”, they are not a
strict rubric. As we'll see in class, this is one of the strengths (and
challenges) of agile software development: you can re-evaluate
requirements and make design changes quickly, but there is no detailed
requirements document that you can use to check whether you’ve
contractually fulfilled your obligations to a customer.

As such, your individual score on the project will be based on how well
you perform certain tasks that you will do throughout the project (and
which you would encounter in any real software project). More
specifically, you will be evaluated based on the following:

-  How well you document tasks/issues
-  Whether you complete the tasks you commit to doing in a given sprint
-  Whether you get pull requests approved

Note: no part of your score will be determined by your teammates’
reviews/feedback. So, when you receive a code review or peer feedback,
we will be evaluating the quality of the code review / peer feedback
itself; we will not be using that review/feedback to determine your
score. Please note that, in peer feedback, we will specifically be
evaluating the person giving the feedback (by looking at the quality of
the feedback they provide).

Each of the above has a different weight:

-  Adding tasks to the backlog: 5 points
-  Tasks/issues: 10 points
-  Getting a pull request approved: 20 points

We will discuss the “backlog” in class but, in essence, it is a list of
pending tasks for the entire project.

Every time you do one of the above, you will be graded on a simple
scale:

-  “check plus plus”: You earn 100% of the point value of the work you
   completed.
-  “check plus”: You earn 90% of the points.
-  “check”: You earn 85% of the points.
-  “check minus”: You earn 80% of the points.
-  “check minus minus”: You earn 75% of the points.

For example, suppose you have completed 3 tasks (graded “check”,
“check”, and “check plus”) gotten a pull request approved (graded
“check”) and added a task to the backlog (graded “check plus plus”). You
will have accrued the following number of points:

.. math::  (0.85\cdot 10) + (0.85\cdot 10) + (0.9\cdot 10) + (0.85\cdot 20) + (1.0\cdot 5) = 8.5+8.5+9+17+5 = 48 

Your individual score (out of 100) is simply the following:

.. math::  \frac{\text{accrued points}}{\text{possible points}}\cdot 100 

In this example, your possible points would be 55 (the sum of the point
value of each piece of work you did). So, your individual score would be
87.27%

The number of points you accrue can be affected in two ways:

-  **Not completing a task you committed to doing.** At the start of
   each sprint, you will take ownership of certain tasks, and will be
   committing to doing them by the end of the sprint. If a task is
   assigned to a sprint, and then is either reassigned to a subsequent
   sprint or placed on the backlog, we will deduct 2 points from your
   score for that task. So, if your task receives a “check”, but it was
   late, you will accrue 6.5 points instead of 8.5.

   Please note that there is some flexibility regarding late tasks (see
   below). Also, take into account that this penalty does not apply to
   tasks beyond the ones you committed to doing (e.g., if you commit to
   doing two tasks, finish them earlier than expected, and there are
   other tasks you could claim, you could do them to potentially
   increase your score)
-  **Too many cooks in the kitchen.** In some occasions, two or more
   people may agree to share responsibility for completing a task or for
   shepherding a pull request to master. This is normal and, when a task
   or pull request is shared by two or more students, then all of those
   students will accrue the points for that task (e.g., if two students
   collaborate on a task that receives a “check minus”, each student
   accrues 8 points out of a possible 10 points).

   However, when a task is shared by four or more students, the task
   will be worth 7 points (instead of 10). For example, if four students
   collaborate on a task, and the task receives a “check”, then all the
   students will accrue 5.95 points out of a possible 7 points (7·0.85 =
   5.95).

As you will find out throughout the project, estimating the time a task
will require can be challenging. You could commit to doing a task
thinking it will only take 2-3 hours, and then find that it is actually
a 10-15 hour task. So, you are allowed to do the following:

-  For tasks that you committed to doing, you are allowed to reassign up
   to four tasks to future sprints, or place them back on the backlog,
   without penalty.
-  | For any task, if you realize that it will take longer than you
     anticipated, you are allowed to close the task and spawn smaller
     tasks in its place. The closed task will then not contribute to
     your individual score.

   Note: The rules are stricter for tasks you have committed to doing.
   You will need the senior developer’s approval to split such a task
   (we will likely approve most reasonable splits, but want to avoid
   anyone arbitrarily splitting a task into many microtasks just to rack
   up points). You will also not be allowed to split them after a
   certain point. In 1-week sprints, you cannot split tasks after
   Thursday. For 2-week sprints, you cannot split tasks after Monday of
   the second week of the sprint. When you split a task you committed to
   doing, you must commit to doing at least one of the subtasks; the
   remaining subtasks can go on the backlog (and you could commit to
   doing them in a subsequent sprint).

Requirements for graded work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tasks/Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^

We will be using GitHub Issues to keep track of tasks in each sprint. At
the team meeting at the start of a sprint, each team member must open a
GitHub issue for each task they commit to doing. An issue must include
the following:

-  A descriptive title
-  A descriptive summary
-  Updates on the progress of the task
-  A closing statement

We describe each of these in more detail in the sections below.

Additionally, when creating an issue, you must take care to fill in the
following fields:

-  **Assignees**: Anyone who will be working on the issue must be added
   here.
-  **Labels**: You must select, at least, the label corresponding to
   your team (the team labels start with ``x/``). *Do not* select labels
   for other teams, even if your work is related to that team. If
   someone from another team is contributing substantially to the issue,
   then they should be added as an Assignee.

   You may also select any number of generic labels that describe the
   nature of the issue (“bug”, “enhancement”, etc.). *Do not* create new
   labels without first checking with an instructor/TA.
-  **Projects**: Make sure that the issue is part of the “CMSC 22000
   Scrum Board”.
-  **Milestone**: Select the sprint this issue is a part of.

For example, this is what the labels, projects, and milestones field
could look like:

.. figure:: issue.png
   :alt: GitHub Issue

   GitHub Issue

**A descriptive title**

The title should be a single sentence summarizing what will be done in
this task.

For example:

1. “Design and implement a ‘circle’ module”
2. “Add support for higher-dimensional points”
3. “Research libraries for drawing simple geometric shapes”
4. “Fix bug in segment intersection when segments overlap perfectly”

We will be referring back to the above four tasks in other examples, and
we will refer to them as “Task #1”, “Task #2”, etc.

For example, here are less-descriptive titles for the above four tasks:

-  Task #1: “Work on circle module” (what work is being done on the
   module?)
-  Task #2: “Higher-dimensional points” (not a complete sentence, not
   clear what you’ll be doing)
-  Task #3: “We need drawing libraries” (that’s true, but what is being
   done about it in this task?)
-  Task #4: “Fix bug” (what bug is being fixed?)

**A descriptive summary**

A descriptive summary of what the task involves. One thing that must be
clear from this summary is how you will know whether the task is done.
Sometimes this is self-explanatory (e.g., if you are fixing a bug, the
task is done when the bug is fixed), but in other cases you should avoid
being too open-ended (e.g., when would you know whether you’re done
“researching libraries”?) It can also be useful to provide context for
why this task has been created.

When a task refers to a bug, the summary should include concrete
instructions for reproducing the bug, including the full and unabridged
output of the steps that lead to the bug manifesting itself.

Here are some examples of descriptive summaries:

**Task #1**

   libgeometry currently lacks a way to work with circles. We need to
   design and implement a module that supports, at least, creating
   circles, computing their area and diameter, and computing
   intersections between circles.

**Task #2**

   libgeometry only supports points in two-dimensional space. We should
   generalize this design to support points in any dimensions, by having
   the ``point_t`` type look like this:

   ::

      typedef struct {
         double *vals;
         unsigned int ndims;
      } point_t;

   The segment and polygon modules will need to be updated to use this
   new type, and their tests will need to be updated. We also need to
   add additional tests for segments and polygons in, at least,
   three-dimensional space.

**Task #3**

   We would like to eventually be able to visualize points, segments,
   and polygons. Before doing this, we should pick a library that easily
   allows us to do this. We should find at least three alternatives, and
   then discuss which one we prefer. If you would like to suggest a
   library, please make sure to include a link to their documentation,
   as well as (if possible) a link to code samples for that library.

**Task #4**

   Computing the intersection of identical segments makes
   ``segment_intersects`` crash. You can reproduce this by running this
   program:

   ::

      #include "segment.h"

      int main()
      {
          segment_t s1, s2;
          point_t p1, p2;

          point_init(&p1, 2.0, 3.0);
          point_init(&p2, 5.0, 7.0);

          segment_init(&s1, &p1, &p2);
          segment_init(&s2, &p1, &p2);

          segment_intersects(&s1, &s2);
      }

   This program immediately segfaults without any other output.

And here are example of summaries that would be less helpful:

**Task #1**

   I’m going to add a circle module

It’s not clear why we’re doing this, or how we’ll know when this task is
done.

**Task #2**

   Turn x, y in point_t to an array. Make sure it doesn’t break any
   other code.

While this describes what will be done in the task and how we’ll know
when it’s done (when any code we break by the update to point_t is
fixed), this needs to be more concrete.

**Task #3**

   Ok, so maybe we want to actually draw the points and segments and
   polygons at some point??? (lol point) Are? There? Libraries? For?
   This? Maybe someone can look them up? 🤔

Task descriptions should be concise and to the point. Jokes and colorful
writing styles can distract from this.

**Task #4**

   If I create two identical segments and check if they intersect, my
   program crashes.

While this provides some indication of what needs to happen for the bug
to manifest itself, the summary should provide concise instructions on
how to reproduce the issue. At the very least, the code for the crashing
program should be included in the task description.

**Updates on the progress of the task**

If you make any intermediate progress before finishing the task,
specially if you have pushed any code related to this task, then it
should be documented on the GitHub issue. For example:

-  In Task #1, suppose you implement a struct to represent circles, as
   well as the new/init/free functions, but have not yet started working
   on area, perimeter, and intersection. You could commit and push that
   code, and post a comment in the issue.
-  In Task #3, you could post a comment every time you finish reviewing
   an individual library (instead of just posting everything together at
   the end)

Pro tip: If you include an issue number in a commit message, then it
will appear automatically in that issue, which will make it easier to
keep track of what commits are associated with a given issue.

Note: Some tasks may simply not lend themselves to reporting any
intermediate progress, in which case the closing statement (described
next) would be enough.

**A closing statement**

When a task is done, you should close the corresponding GitHub issue,
and you should include a comment explaining why this task is done. In
some cases, this is as simple as stating that the work has been done.
For example, in Task #1 you could simply state “Implemented the circle
module, including the area, perimeter, and intersection functions”.

This may seem redundant, but take into account that closing an issue may
not necessarily mean that the task is done. For example, the following
could also be valid closing statements for Task #1:

-  “We ultimately decided we don’t need a circle module after all. I’m
   closing this issue, but will reopen if we decide to revisit this”
-  “The circle module has been implemented, except for the intersection
   function, which turned out to be more complex than anticipated. I am
   closing this issue, and have created a separate task (#5) for
   implementing circle intersections”

Pull Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Like in many software projects, the ``master`` branch of our Git
repository should only contain stable code that compiles, runs, and
passes all tests. This is enforced by making the master branch a
*protected* branch, meaning that only the instructors and TAs have the
ability to directly push to that branch.

On top of that, there is an additional ``dev`` (short for “development”)
branch that acts as a “pre-master” branch. The ``dev`` branch is also
protected, and should only contain stable code, but it is used as a
staging area to integrate code (and uncover potential integration
issues) before publishing code to ``master``.

This means that, to get code into chiventure, you must make pull request
to get code merged into the ``dev`` branch (and the instructor and TAs
will decide when to merge that code into ``master``).

Because the ``dev`` branch should contain stable code, pull requests to
``dev`` must be carefully reviewed before they are approved. If you want
to merge code into ``dev``, your code must be reviewed by (1) someone in
your team and (2) your senior developer. When your code affects code
owned by another team, you must have an additional reviewer from each
team whose code is affected.

A pull request should contain a relatively self-contained piece of work.
In fact, it is not uncommon for a task (or, at most, 2-3 tasks) to
result in a pull request. We encourage you to touch base with your
senior developer before creating your first pull requests, to determine
whether the work you want to merge merits a pull request (or, similarly,
whether it needs to be broken up into multiple pull requests).

Like a task, a pull request should have a descriptive title, a
descriptive summary, updates on the progress of the pull request
(especially since changes may need to be done based on the code
reviews), and a closing statement. The assignees for the pull request
must be everyone who contributed to the code that is being merged. If a
pull request is approved, all assignees and reviewers will receive the
points for that pull request.

Take into account that the final outcome of a pull request could be for
that pull request to be denied. If this happens, it will not impact your
score (the effect will be the same as if you had never made the pull
request to begin with).

Peer feedback
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Twice throughout the project, each student will provide feedback to two
other students in their own team. This is similar to a peer
evaluation/review (which are fairly common in large software projects),
except the feedback you provide will have no effect on the recipient’s
grade (whereas in a real project, these evaluations/reviews could affect
whether you get a raise, a promotion, etc.). Instead, we will be
assessing the feedback you provide to others.

At the end of Sprints 2 and 3, you will be assigned two peers who will
be providing you with feedback (you will know each other’s identities).
Before they provide you with feedback, you must think about what you
would like to receive feedback on. At the end of Sprint 2, you should
think about the following:

   *What is something I’d like to improve or do better in the next
   sprints?*

After Sprint 3 (i.e., during the final Sprint 4), you should think about
the following:

   *What is something I’d like to improve or do better the next time I
   work in a complex software project and/or the next time I work in a
   team?*

Based on this, you should prepare prompts for specific feedback, which
can range from organizational/teamwork aspects (e.g., wanting to improve
how you communicate with the rest of the team) to technical aspects
(e.g., wanting to improve your understanding of some programming
concepts), as well as from concrete to high-level. You are also welcome
to provide additional prompts that don’t originate from the above
questions. Once you have your prompt(s), you should convey them to the
students who will be providing you with feedback (you can communicate
this directly to them, via Slack, e-mail, etc.; you do not need to
include the instructor or TAs in this communication)

For example, you could provide prompts like the following (the first two
are examples of relatively high-level prompts, while the latter three
are more specific):

1. I feel like I’m using Slack and GitHub effectively, but I wonder if
   there are any ways in which I could be using them more effectively.
2. I always procrastinate on my tasks until the 1-2 days before they are
   due, and I’d like to make more steady progress throughout the sprint.
   Do you have any suggestions on how I could do this?
3. Sometimes I feel like I go off and work on one of my tasks, and when
   I touch base with everyone else after a few days, some of the work
   I’ve done turns out to be headed in the wrong direction, and it seems
   like that could’ve been avoided if I had known what everyone else was
   doing. How could I make sure I stay informed of everyone else’s
   progress?
4. I feel like I sometimes derail conversations by getting too lost in
   the weeds when talking about my work, even though I may have a
   valuable point to make. Do you also feel like I’m doing this? If so,
   what other ways do you think I could make this point instead of the
   way I’m doing it now?
5. I know we create tasks at the start of each sprint, and I know which
   ones I’m going to be working on but, if I’m working with other people
   on the task, sometimes I’m not sure what exactly I should be working
   on. How can I make sure this doesn’t happen?

After you convey these prompts to the students who will be giving you
feedback, they must convey that feedback to you. Please give your
feedback givers at least one day to think about your prompts; after
that, we encourage you to meet synchronously via Zoom (ideally with both
the feedback givers at the same time) to discuss your feedback (if
synchronously is hard to arrange, they can also convey their feedback
over Slack, e-mail, etc.)

In the end, you must write a brief report (at least 3-4 paragraphs, and
ideally no more than 700 words) for each of the two pieces of feedback
you provide (each to a separate student). This report must include the
following:

-  The prompts you were given
-  How the feedback was conveyed. If you met in person, please specify
   when, for how long, and whether it was a one-on-one meeting, or
   whether the other feedback giver was there.
-  A summary of the feedback you conveyed.
-  For the second round of peer feedbacks, mention whether there was any
   follow-up on the feedback you provided in the first round of feedback
   (e.g., if the feedback recipient acted on some of your feedback, and
   told you the outcome).

We will provide submission instructions once we are closer to the peer
feedback.

Final Presentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Requirements for the final presentation can be found `here <presentation.html>`__.

Class-wide bonus points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The entire class can earn up to two points of extra credit if a person
(chosen by the instructor/TAs) is able to do the following without any
assistance, other than the documentation provided on the chiventure
repository:

-  Clone the chiventure repository
-  Build chiventure
-  Load a game
-  Be able to play through the game, and do at least the following:

   -  Explore at least three rooms
   -  Interact with two objects
   -  Place an object in their inventory, and then use it for something
   -  Try some nonsensical actions (putting a door in your inventory,
      opening something that can’t be opened, etc.) and get reasonable
      messages from chiventure.
   -  Make use of at least two new features introduced this year.

The user must be able to do this without chiventure crashing or
producing any runtime error/warning messages. While the user will not be
affiliated with this class, you may assume the user is tech-savvy and
familiar with text adventure games (but not with chiventure
specifically).

You will have three tries to unlock these bonus points, and you must
notify us when you want us to arrange for a user to test chiventure. If
the test succeeds on the first try, the entire class will receive two
bonus points. On the second try, you will receive 1.5 bonus points. On
the third try, you will receive one point.

Team Composition and Mobility
-----------------------------

You will be assigned to teams based on your answers to a team assignment
survey. At the start of the project, the composition of these teams will
be immovable: please do not ask us to change it.

However, it is not uncommon in software projects for developers to
interest themselves in the work done by other teams. So, if you find
another team’s work to be interesting, we encourage you to look through
the code they’re writing, poke your head into their Slack channel, etc.
You can even offer to help with some of their tasks (especially
backlogged tasks), which will also earn you points. Just make sure
you’re still completing the tasks for your team, and that you discuss
with the other team before you do any work on one of their tasks (e.g.,
“Hey, I saw issue #XXX in your backlog and I may have some extra time to
work on that. Is that ok?”)

Sometimes, these collaborations result in someone becoming so interested
in another team’s work that they end up asking to be reassigned to that
team. In this class, you will be allowed to switch to a different team
after the 2nd sprint, as long as the following conditions are met:

-  You must have been doing some work for the other team already, and
   must be able to point to completed tasks related to that team.
-  The switch should be motivated by the work the other team is doing,
   and because you want to be involved in it. We will not allow you to
   switch just because you want to be in a team with a particular person
   from that team.
-  Both teams (including the senior developer for each team) must be ok
   with this switch.
-  No team can end up with less than 4 members, or with more than 6
   members.
