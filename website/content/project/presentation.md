The final component of this course will be a series of final presentations, where each team will present the work they have done throughout the quarter. The presentations will take place on Wednesday, June 12, from 1:30pm to 3:30pm, in Ryerson 277. Each team will have 15 minutes to present (with an additional 5 minutes for questions).

## Presentation Contents

Each presentation must be divided into three portions: a high-level discussion of how you designed and implemented your component, a demo, and reflections.

### Design and Implementation

You must explain, at a high-level, the design of your component, and any non-trivial implementation details (like the use of external libraries)

### Demo

You must do a live demo of chiventure that specifically highlights the work your team was responsible for. You must do this demo from the version of the code that is in `master`.

### Reflections

You must discuss at least three (and no more than five) aspects of the software development process which you found challenging and/or rewarding. We encourage you to decouple these as much as possible from the structure of this particular class. In other words, reflect upon what aspects of developing software as part of a team (and with other teams), and using the tools that facilitate this process (GitHub, Slack, Travis, etc.) proved to be more challenging (and/or rewarding) than simply working individually.

You must also discuss at least one thing that you would've done differently with the benefit of hindsight.

## Presentation Format

We suggest you allocate roughly 5 minutes for each portion of the presentation. That said, it would be prudent to plan to speak for no more than 12-13 minutes, to give yourself some wiggle room. Please note that the design/implementation and demo portions can be interwoven together, as opposed to treating them as completely distinct portions.

Take into account that the demo/presentation itself doesn't have to be delivered by all team members. In fact, for a 15 minute presentation, you probably want no more than 2-3 people speaking in total (but as many of you should be at the presentation, in case there are any questions that need to be answered by a specific team member)

You do not need to dress formally for the presentations. Casual clothing is more than acceptable but, if you do feel the need to look a bit sharper, please don't wear anything more formal than [smart casual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_casual) or [business casual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_casual).

## Scoring

The presentation will be worth 10 points of your final grade. 6 of these points will be determined by the instructor and TAs, and the remaining 4 points will be determined by a panel of guest judges. The  instructor/TAs will score your presentation (on a scale of 0 to 5) on three aspects: Clarity/structure (weighed 40%), demo (weighed 35%) and Q&A (weighed 25%). The guest judges will score your presentation only on clarity/structure (75%) and Q&A (25%).

Both the instructor/TAs and guest judges will use the following rubric, with discretion to add/subtract half a point.

### Clarity and structure

- 5 points: Flawless presentation.
- 4 points: Overall well structured. Only a few minor hiccups and/or aspects that were not entirely clear.
- 2.5 points: Needs improvement. Presentation was poorly structured with multiple aspects that were not clear.
- 1 point: Poorly structured. Presentation does not substantially address the content we requested.
- 0: No presentation was delivered.

### Demo (instructor/TAs only)

- 5 points: Flawless demo that highlights the team's work.
- 4 points: Smooth demo with only a few small hiccups.
- 2.5 points: Needs improvement. Demo worked but with major issues.
- 1 point: Very incomplete demo. Demo hints at the work the team did, but doesn't directly showcase their work.
- 0: No demo was done.

### Q&A

- 5 points: All questions were answered
- 4 points: Most questions were answered, but the team was stumped on some of them.
- 2.5 points: The team was stumped on most of the questions they were asked.
- 1 point: The team was stumped on all questions.
- 0 points: The team did not answer any of the questions they were asked.


## Presentation and demo tips

- If you're unsure whether your laptop will work with the projector, get to the room before 1:30pm and do a quick test (I have verified that no one is using it before us)
- You should make sure to present from a single laptop, and you should run through the demo on that laptop a couple times before the actual presentation.
- You should declare the `master` branch to be frozen at some point before the presentations (and after you have run through a successful demo with the code in that branch). We suggest aiming to freeze the `master` branch at least 24 hours before the presentation, and only allowing changes that do not affect your code (e.g., documentation changes, READMEs, etc.) or, at most, very small hotfixes.
- Always have a contingency plan. Sometimes demos don't work and, while that is not ideal, you will not cause a bad impression if you bow out gracefully. Either give up on the demo immediately or, if the laptop is at least projecting, then have screenshots prepared to share with everyone. 
- When you have a limited amount of time, don't improvise your demo. Think about what you will show exactly, and stick to your script. If something fails, don't try to fix it on the spot. Move on with the rest of the demo and, if that is not possible, give up on the demo gracefully.


Teams will be given an opportunity to do a dry run of their presentation. At this dry run, we would provide feedback on your presentation's structure and style, to make sure you have a chance to polish it up before the actual presentation.
