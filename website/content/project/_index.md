In the course project, you will be divided into teams of five students, and will work collaboratively (both within your team and between teams) to create a complex software system that will involve designing and implementing a number of components. You will be using several tools to support the collaborative aspects of this project and, indeed, your collaborative skills will be as important as your coding skills to be successful in this project.

The following pages provide more details on the requirements of the project:

* [chiventure: a Text Adventure Game Engine]({{< relref "chiventure.md" >}}): The project you will be implementing
* [Project Policies]({{< relref "policies.md" >}}): A detailed description of how the project is structured, how you will be evaluated, etc.
* [Features]({{< relref "features.md" >}}): The features that teams can be assigned to work on.

Additionally, the course project also involves two warm-up exercises that you will do with your teams, and which revolve around software design:
