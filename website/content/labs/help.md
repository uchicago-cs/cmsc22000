If you have any questions or get stuck on the lab assignments, there are two ways of getting help:

### Slack

We have a `#course-labs` channel on our Slack workspace that can be used to ask questions about the lab assignments. However, to keep that channel tidy we ask that you follow a couple of conventions in this channel.

The most important convention is that there should be one "thread" per question. In Slack, you can reply to a message, creating a thread of replies under that message. This makes it easier to keep track of what messages are replying to a specific question (without threading, things can get messy if there are a lot of questions being asked at the same time).

So, if you wanted to ask a question, you would just post your question on the `#course-labs` channel:

![Question on Slack](/cmsc22000/img/question-1.png "Question on Slack")

Let's say that question was actually asked by someone else, and you wanted to reply to it. You must do so by starting a thread:

![Starting a thread](/cmsc22000/img/question-2.png "Starting a thread")

You will be able to write a reply and, once you post it, it will appear under the original question:

![Slack thread](/cmsc22000/img/question-3.png "Slack thread")

If you want to see the replies in an existing thread, you just need to click on the reply link (in the above example, you would click on "1 reply" and that would show you the existing replies, and will also allow you to provide your own reply). This will show you the replies, and will also allow you to write an additional reply:

![Slack thread](/cmsc22000/img/question-4.png "Slack thread")

If you asked the original question, it's important for the course staff to know when your question has been answered to your satisfaction. If you feel your question has been resolved, you should add the "resolved" reaction to it. You can do this by clicking on "Add reaction":

![Adding a reaction](/cmsc22000/img/question-5.png "Adding a reaction")

And selecting the "resolved" emoji (note: this is an alias for the "heavy_check_mark" emoji; you can use that one as well)

![Resolved reaction](/cmsc22000/img/question-6.png "Resolved reaction")

Note: An instructor or TA may also use the resolved emoji if they feel like the question has been resolved but, if it hasn't, you should feel free to remove the reaction, and post a reply on the thread to clarify that you still need assistance with that question.

### Zoom Office Hours

We will also be holding office hours over Zoom to provide one-on-one assistance with lab assignments. We will post details on these soon.
