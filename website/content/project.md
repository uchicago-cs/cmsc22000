In the course project, you will be divided into six teams of five students, and will work collaboratively (both within your team and between teams) to create a complex software system that will involve designing and implementing a number of components. You will be using several tools to support the collaborative aspects of this project and, indeed, your collaborative skills will be as important as your coding skills to be successful in this project.

Details on this year's project will be posted at the start of the Project Phase of the class. For reference, you can see [last year's project]({{< relref "projects/2018/" >}}). However, please note that this year's project will be completely different, and will a substantially different grading scheme (most notably, we will not be using a normalized grading scheme requiring curving)
