Course Description
------------------

Developing a software system (e.g., an application, a web server, an operating system, etc.) requires much more than just knowing how to program. Software development encompasses multiple activities, such as systems design, implementation, testing, debugging, deployment, documentation, and maintenance, all weaved together by following a specific methodology. Not just that, software development is a highly collaborative activity, where certain soft skills, like effective communication and the ability to give/receive feedback, can be key to the success of a software project.

This class bridges the gap between knowing how to program and knowing how to develop software: it is intended for students who have just completed CMSC 15200 Introduction to Computer Science 2 or CMSC 16200 Honors Introduction to Computer Science 2, and will cover fundamental concepts and skills in software development, providing a solid foundation before students move on to majors-level classes that require developing complex software systems. The class will cover foundational topics in software development in lectures, but will also include hands-on labs, guest lectures from industry speakers, and a collaborative quarter-long project, where the entire class, divided into teams with specific responsibilities, will work on developing new features for an existing software system.

In this course, students will learn how to...

* ... follow a software development process/methodology to manage the life cycle of a software system.
* ... use tools that support the software development process (e.g., build systems, testing frameworks, debuggers, etc.)
* ... develop software collaboratively through (a) the use of tools, systems, and best practices available to facilitate that collaboration (e.g., version control systems, code reviews, task tracking, etc.), and (b) exercising collaborative soft skills (communication, giving/accepting feedback, etc.) 

### Prerequisites

Students must have taken CMSC 15200 or CMSC 16200. 

In Spring 2020, students will have to apply to participate in this class, and only students taking CMSC 15200 or CMSC 16200 in Winter 2020, or who took CMSC 15200 in Spring 2019, will be considered (*absolutely no exceptions will be made*).

Please note that CMSC 15400 is *not* a prerequisite for this class. We strongly encourage students taking CMSC 22000 to defer CMSC 15400 until the Fall, instead of taking CMSC 22000 and CMSC 15400 concurrently.


Course Organization
-------------------

Lectures are scheduled to take place on MWF 2:30pm - 3:20pm, but please note that, in Spring 2020, we will generally only meet on Mondays and Fridays for discussion-oriented meetings over Zoom, with most of the course content delivered via pre-recorded lectures. Please see [Course Calendar]({{< relref "calendar.md" >}}) page for the exact days/times when we will meet over Zoom.

Additionally, we have time reserved on Mondays 4:30pm-5:50pm for project teams meetings (this is listed as a "lab" on the Registrar's site, but please note that it is unrelated to the lab assignments in this class). Team meetings will start on Week 3.

A large part of the class will revolve around the development of a software project where students will be able to apply many of the concepts covered in the lectures (this project is described in more detail in the "Course Project" section below). In this project, the entire class will work on the same code (through public GitHub repositories visible to the entire class). Students will be divided into teams of 4-5 students, and each team will work on a specific aspect of the project. In each team, a TA will act as the senior developer in the team. Students will be assessed both on their performance as a team, as well as on their performance on individual tasks assigned to them in their teams.

Lab assignments will supplement the material covered in lectures, and will allow students to learn and practice skills that will be necessary in the course project. Please note that there is no actual lab session; instead, these are self-guided labs to do in your own time, and with a number of exercises that have to be done individually before a given deadline.

During the first two weeks of the quarter, the class will focus on covering core concepts regarding the software development process. Starting in week 3, the focus of the class will shift towards the development of the course project, with Mondays used for a project all-hands meeting, and each team having a 30-minute meeting with the team's senior developer during lab hours.

Course Project
--------------

The course project revolves around developing a complex software system. The scope and complexity of this project will require that the entire class work together towards developing a fully-featured software product.

More specifically, the entire class will be working on the same codebase. The class will be divided into teams of 4-5 students, with an undergraduate TA acting as a "senior developer" in each of these teams (TAs will be students who have previously taken CMSC 22000 and/or who have prior industry experience via internships) Teams will be arranged by the instructor/TAs (they will not be self-selecting).

During Weeks 2-3, the teams will work on a warmup exercise on software design. A design exercise will be assigned in Week 2 (due Week 3), and a follow-up exercise will be assigned in Week 3 (due Week 4). Teams will get feedback on their first exercise before the second one is due, and there will be a Zoom session in Week 3 dedicated to discussing the design exercise.

Starting in Week 3, project planning will follow a Scrum-like process, with weeks 3-9 of the quarter being divided into several sprints. Starting on Week 3, all teams have an all-hands meeting during Monday class hours, and each team will have an additional team meeting during the lab section of the class. Teams will keep track of their tasks through GitHub issues, with grading primarily based on their performance on these tasks.

More details on the project can be found on the [Project]({{< relref "project.md" >}}) page.

Grading
-------

Grading is based on the following:

* 25% Lab Assignments (each lab weighed equally)
* 5% Participation (see Spring 2020 below)
* 70% Project, divided into:
  * 5% Team Design Exercise
  * 35% Individual Evaluation
  * 15% Team Evaluation
  * 5% Peer Feedback
  * 10% Final Presentation

See the the [Project]({{< relref "project.md" >}}) page for more details on how the project scores are determined.

Additionally, there are 2 points of extra credit that are unlocked by completing a final goal in the course project (this goal is such that it can only be reached if all teams have substantially completed and integrated their work for the project). If these extra points are unlocked, they are awarded to everyone in the class.

Grades are not curved in this class or, at least, not in the traditional sense. We use a standard set of grade boundaries:

* 95-100: A
* 90-95: A-
* 85-90: B+
* 80-85: B
* 75-80: B-
* 70-75: C+
* < 70: Dealt on a case-by-case basis

We curve only to the extent that we may lower the boundaries for one or more letter grades, depending on the distribution of the raw scores. 

### Lab Assignment Regrades

We sometimes make mistakes, and are happy to review any grading decision on the lab assignments that you feel is unfair or unjustified. However, it is also your responsibility to make these requests in a timely manner. Requests for regrades must be submitted no later than **one week** after a graded lab assignment is returned to you. After that time, we will not consider any requests for regrades, *regardless of whether the regrade request is reasonable and justified*.

Books
-----

While this class does not have a required textbook, most of the Software Engineering content draws heavily from Ian Sommerville's book, [Software Engineering](http://iansommerville.com/software-engineering-book/). Please see [Additional Resources]({{< relref "resources.md" >}}) for a number of other books and online resources covering much of the material in this class.


Diversity Statement
-------------------

The University of Chicago is committed to diversity and rigorous inquiry that arises from multiple perspectives. We concur with that commitment and also believe that we have the highest quality interactions and can creatively solve more problems when we recognize and share our diversity. We thus expect to maintain a productive learning environment based upon open communication, mutual respect, and non-discrimination. We view the diversity that students bring to this class as a resource, strength and benefit. It is our intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, religious background, and immigration status. Any suggestions as to how to further such a positive and open environment in the class will be appreciated and given serious consideration.

If you have a preferred name different from what appears on the class roster, or preferred gender pronouns you would like us to use, please let us know.

Spring 2020
-----------

There are a few aspects of the class that will be a bit unique in Spring 2020:

### Participation Score

5 points (out of 100) of your final grade will be allocated to attendance in Zoom sessions and watching pre-recorded lectures (students who are unable to join Zoom sessions will have an alternate mechanism for earning participation points). The intent of the participation points is that any student who attends most of the Zoom sessions and watches most of the pre-recorded lectures will effortlessly earn the full 5 points. The points are allocated as follows:

- 2 points for attending Zoom sessions. If you attend at least 75% of the Zoom sessions, you get the full 2 points. Please note that it is enough to attend the session and be present for all or nearly all of it. If you attend less than 75% of the Zoom sessions, you get a number of points proportional to the number of Zoom sessions you attended.
  
  Students who are prevented from joining the Zoom sessions (due to their timezone, Internet access, or some other personal difficulty) can earn these points by, instead, suggesting questions for the discussion/Q&A sessions (which will revolve around the content provided in pre-recorded lectures). While any student will be able to submit questions, the students who are unable to participate in Zoom sessions can earn the 2 points by submitting two questions before a Zoom discussion session (similarly, they get the full 2 points if they submit questions for at least 75% of the Zoom sessions)
  
- 3 points for viewing pre-recorded lectures. The pre-recorded lectures will include very simple quizzes that should be trivial to pass if you pay attention to the videos. If your total score on the quizzes is above 75%, you get the full 3 points; below 75% you get a proportional score.

### Late submission of lab assignments

To add some flexibility to your coursework this quarter, we have setup Gradescope to accept lab submissions up to 48 hours after their deadline. We will not penalize your first two late submissions but, after that, any late submission will have a 20 point penalty (out of 100). Submissions will not be accepted 48 hours after the deadline, but we will make exceptions for students who are facing any additional personal difficulties (if so, please notify the instructor before the deadline, if possible)

### Zoom Guidelines

*Note: The following is based on text provided by Prof. Stuart Kurtz*

We will be using Zoom in this class. We expect your interactions via Zoom to be consistent with an in-person class experience. Respect the people you're working with. Enter the Zoom meetings muted if possible (unfortunately, it will not be possible if you're calling in), and unmute to speak. Raise your hand if you'd like to speak. [There's a "Raise Hand" button on the participant page.] If your background is unusually noisy, use the chat channel instead of unmuting. You may show video, but you're not required to, and you may turn off video sharing at any time.

Note that you can set your name in your Zoom profile, so you don't have to go with whatever was assigned. We encourage you to include your pronouns in your name (if so, please include them after your last name). If you set a name that can't be easily matched to the name on record with the University, please let us know.

Our Zoom class meetings will be recorded and saved to the cloud to allow students in this class to review the discussion, and especially to allow students who can't participate the opportunity to benefit from class. It is not our intention that these recordings will be available to anyone but class participants, nor that they will be available after the quarter, but we don't have control over what others will do. If you have FERPA concerns, please mask yourself accordingly, e.g., by turning off video and using an alias.

### Recording Policy

*The following is the verbatim policy adopted by the university. Please make sure you understand it and abide by it.*

As the University temporarily transitions to a remote teaching and learning environment, instructors
and students have asked for guidance on the recording of course sessions. Instructors have the
discretion to record course sessions, except when recording is required to meet the needs of students
granted an accommodation by the Office of Student Disability Services. Recordings and transcripts will
be made available to students in the relevant course, the instructor, and other necessary University
officials. Recordings in which students are personally identifiable will be managed in accordance with
the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).

This time-limited policy has been implemented to effectively deliver a remote education while
safeguarding privacy and protecting rights in courses and instructional materials. Below is an
acknowledgment for students designed to govern the use of any recordings and provide instructors and
students with guidance on the use of instructional materials.
By attending course sessions, students acknowledge that:

1. They will not: (i) record, share, or disseminate University of Chicago course sessions, videos,
transcripts, audio, or chats; (ii) retain such materials after the end of the course; or (iii) use such
materials for any purpose other than in connection with participation in the course.

2. They will not share links to University of Chicago course sessions with any persons not
authorized to be in the course session. Sharing course materials with persons authorized to be
in the relevant course is permitted. Syllabi, handouts, slides, and other documents may be
shared at the discretion of the instructor.

3. Course recordings, content, and materials may be covered by copyrights held by the University,
the instructor, or third parties. Any unauthorized use of such recordings or course materials may
violate such copyrights.

4. Any violation of this policy will be referred to the Area Dean of Students.
