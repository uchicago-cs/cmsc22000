Course Description
------------------

Developing a software system (e.g., an application, a web server, an operating system, etc.) requires much more than just knowing how to program. Software development encompasses multiple activities, such as systems design, implementation, testing, debugging, deployment, documentation, and maintenance, all weaved together by following a specific methodology. Not just that, software development is a highly collaborative activity, where certain soft skills, like effective communication and the ability to give/receive feedback, can be key to the success of a software project.

This class bridges the gap between knowing how to program and knowing how to develop software: it is intended for students who have just completed CMSC 15200 or CMSC 16200, and will cover fundamental concepts and skills in software development, providing a solid foundation before students move on to 200-level classes that require developing complex software systems. The class will cover foundational topics in software development in lectures, but will also include hands-on labs, guest lectures from industry speakers, and a collaborative quarter-long project, where the entire class, divided into teams with specific responsibilities, will work on developing new features for an existing software system.

In this course, students will learn how to...

* ... follow a software development process/methodology to manage the life cycle of a software system.
* ... use tools that support the software development process (e.g., build systems, testing frameworks, debuggers, etc.)
* ... develop software collaboratively through (a) the use of tools, systems, and best practices available to facilitate that collaboration (e.g., version control systems, code reviews, task tracking, etc.), and (b) exercising collaborative soft skills (communication, giving/accepting feedback, etc.) 

### Prerequisites

Students must have taken CMSC 15200 or CMSC 16200. 

In Spring 2018, students will have to apply to participate in this class, and only students taking CMSC 15200 or CMSC 16200 in Winter 2018 will be considered (*absolutely no exceptions will be made*). For Spring 2019, we expect enrolment to be open only to students taking taking CMSC 15200 or CMSC 16200 in Winter 2019, but this is not yet set in stone.

Please note that CMSC 15400 is *not* a prerequisite for this class. We strongly encourage students taking CMSC 22000 to defer CMSC 15400 until the Fall, instead of taking CMSC 22000 and CMSC 15400 concurrently.


Course Organization
-------------------

The class meets three times a week for lectures (MWF 9:30am - 10:20am in Ryerson 277), and once a week for a lab (Thursdays, 5pm-6:20pm in CSIL 3+4).

A large part of the class will revolve around the development of a software project where students will be able to apply many of the concepts covered in the lectures (this project is described in more detail in the "Course Project" section below). In this project, the entire class will work on the same code (through public GitHub repositories visible to the entire class). Students will be divided into teams of 4-5 students, and each team will work on a specific aspect of the project. In each team, an undergraduate TA (in their 3rd or 4th year) will act as the senior developer in the team. Students will be assessed both on their performance as a team, as well as on their performance on individual tasks assigned to them in their teams.

Labs will supplement the material covered in lectures, and will allow students to learn and practice skills that will be necessary in the course project. At the lab, students will be assigned self-contained exercises that have to be done individually and due before the next lab.

During the first three weeks of the quarter, the lecture sessions will involve lectures by the instructor on core concepts regarding the software development process. Starting in week 4, the focus of the class will shift towards the development of the course project, and the lecture sessions will switch to the following:

* **Mondays**: Sprint reviews and all-hands meetings
* **Wednesdays**: Traditional lecture
* **Friday**: Guest lecture from outside speaker

Additionally, each team will have a weekly 30-minute meeting with the instructor and the team's senior developer outside of class hours.

Course Project
--------------

The course project revolves around taking an existing software project, and developing new features for that project, including applications that will use those new features. The scope and complexity of this project will require that the entire class work together towards developing those features. 

More specifically, the entire class will be working on the same codebase. The class will be divided into teams of 4-5 students, with an undergraduate TA acting as a "senior developer" in each of these teams (TAs will be 3rd/4th year undergraduate students with prior industry experience via internships) Teams will be arranged by the instructor/TAs (they will not be self-selecting).

Project planning will follow a Scrum-like process, with weeks 4-10 of the quarter being divided into several sprints. Starting on Week 4, all teams have an all-hands meeting during Monday class hours, and each team will have an additional team meeting outside of class hours. Teams will keep track of their tasks through GitHub issues, with grading primarily based on their performance on these tasks.

More details on the project can be found on the [Project]({{< relref "project.md" >}}) page.

Grading
-------

Grading is based on the following:

* 30% Labs (each lab weighed equally)
* 70% Project, divided into:
  * 40% individual evaluation
  * 20% team evaluation
  * 10% final presentation

See the the [Project]({{< relref "project.md" >}}) page for more details on how the project scores are determined.

Books
-----

While this class does not have a required textbook, most of the Software Engineering content draws heavily from Ian Sommerville's book, [Software Engineering](http://iansommerville.com/software-engineering-book/). Please see [Additional Resources]({{< relref "resources.md" >}}) for a number of other books and online resources covering much of the material in this class.
