**Does CMSC 22000 fulfill any CS major requirements?**

Yes, it can be counted as an elective in the CS major.


**Can CMSC 22000 be used as a replacement for CMSC 15400?**

No, CMSC 15400 is still required in the CS major. However, you are allowed to take CMSC 22000 between CMSC 15200 / 16200 and CMSC 15400.


**Can I take CMSC 22000 concurrently with CMSC 15400?**

This is technically possible, but strongly discouraged. You will get the most out of CMSC 22000 and CMSC 15400 if you take them on separate quarters, instead of at the same time.


**What is the difference between CMSC 22000 and CMSC 22001?**

*CMSC 22001 - Software Construction* is intended primarily for students who are farther along in the CS major (typically 3rd and 4th year students), and revolves around designing a software project from scratch (and covering the Software Engineering concepts and skills necessary to do so).

*CMSC 22000 - Introduction to Software Development*, on the other hand, is intended for students who are coming straight out of the CS intro sequences and revolves around how to engage with larger software systems than those you see in an intro sequence (but without designing those systems from scratch). It covers a number of concepts/skills in software development (and a little of software engineering) that can better prepare students for taking 200-level classes that involve complex software projects (specially systems classes like Networks, Operating Systems, Parallel Computing, etc.)
