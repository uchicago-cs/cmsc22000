  <h1>Project Features

  <div class="container content">
  <p>Each team will be assigned to work on a specific feature of chiventure. Each team will have a chance to express a preference, and we will aim to assign each team to a feature they have expressed very high interest in.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-features">Types of features</h3>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are two types of features you will be able to work on: those that involve improving and maintaining existing code in chiventure, and those that involve implementing new features.</p>
<h4 id="existing-features">Existing features</h4>
<p>Working on existing features involves diving into existing code, understanding it, and figuring out how to build additional functionality into that feature. Knowing how to do this is a <em>very</em> useful skill, but it also means there are fewer design opportunities (since some of the major design decisions will have already been made). To be clear, building additional functionality into an existing feature still involves some design, just not as much as if you were building an entirely new feature.</p>
<p>The existing features that you can work on in Spring 2020 are the components listed in the <a href="/cmsc22000/project/chiventure/">chiventure</a> page: WDL, Game State, Action Management, CLI, and UI.</p>
<p>One perk of working on an existing feature is that there is already plenty of work that can be done in each of these features. Once you familiarize yourself with the code, you can start working on any number of issues on the project <a href="https://github.com/uchicago-cs/chiventure/milestone/6">backlog</a>, before you think about building any substantially new functionality into that feature.</p>
<h4 id="new-features">New features</h4>
<p>chiventure has a <a href="https://github.com/uchicago-cs/chiventure/wiki/Feature-Wishlist">Feature Wishlist</a> with a list of features that do not currently exist in chiventure, but which would be nice to add.</p>
<p>Working on a new feature involves more design work up front, as well as more freedom to decide how the feature will be implemented. On the other hand, it can be more challenging to come up with tasks to work on, since you&rsquo;re not starting from an existing backlog of tasks, and you have to be willing to adapt to changing requirements. All that said, figuring out a path to implement a new feature is a very valuable skill to have (and you still get to dive into existing code, but not to the extent that you would if you were working on an existing feature).</p>
<h3 id="choosing-a-feature">Choosing a feature</h3>
<p>Your team will be asked to score every feature on a scale of -5 to +5, where +5 is &ldquo;we would all absolutely love to work on this component&rdquo;, -5 is &ldquo;every single person on the team would be unhappy if we had to work on this component&rdquo;, and 0 is &ldquo;we have no strong feelings one way or the other&rdquo;. While we encourage you to come up with these scores via discussion within your team, you can also ask each team member to score each feature as -1, 0, or +1; adding up these individual scores can give you a sense of what the team is leaning towards, and can help focus your discussion (by discarding features that clearly most of you are not thrilled about).</p>
<p>Another important thing you need to understand about your choice of features is that, while some features may be more challenging than others, and some may involve more design work than others, <strong>the difficulty and nature of the feature has no direct impact on your grade</strong>. Remember: in this class you are being evaluated on how well you follow a software development process, not on the functionality you are able to produce by the end of the quarter (see <a href="/cmsc22000/project/policies/#project-evaluation">Project Evaluation</a> in the <a href="/cmsc22000/project/policies/">Project Policies</a>). So, for example, you could choose a challenging feature and not have a working prototype by the end of the quarter, but that would not be a factor in determining your grade. Similarly, you could choose a less challenging feature, but walk away with a bad grade if you don&rsquo;t follow a software development process properly.</p>
<p>In the end, you should pick a feature because you&rsquo;re interested in what that feature involves, and because you think the nature of the work (working on an existing feature vs working on a new feature) is appealing to you.</p>
