<h1>Final Report and Demo<a class="headerlink" href="#final-report-and-demo" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>This website currently reflects the Spring 2022 offering of CMSC 22000. We are in
the process of updating this page for the Autumn 2023 offering of CMSC 22000,
which will include several major changes to the class. Most notably, the class
will now be taught in Python (instead of C) and will revolve around the development
of a Python-based web application.</p>
</div>
<p>The final component of this course will be a final report, where each
team will summarize the work they have done throughout the quarter,
as well as a live demo during the “final exam” slot for the class
(Wednesday, June 1st, 10am-12pm).</p>
<section id="final-report">
<h2>Final Report<a class="headerlink" href="#final-report" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The report will be divided into three portions: a high-level
discussion of how you designed and implemented your feature,
a list of possible next steps in your feature,
and a series of reflections.</p>
<section id="design-and-implementation">
<h3>Design and Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#design-and-implementation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>You must explain, at a high-level, the design of your component, and any
non-trivial implementation details (like the use of external libraries).
You should also take care to explain the main dependencies your code has
with the rest of chiventure.</p>
<p>Please note that this section of the report should <strong>not</strong> be a comprehensive description
of every single file and function of your code. Instead, you should focus
on describing <strong>at a high level</strong> the features you added or improved in chiventure,
including any modules, data structures, etc. you implemented.</p>
<p>A good way
to think about this section is to imagine that it will be read
by students in following years who will continue working on
your feature. When writing this part of the report, ask yourself what information
would be useful to future students, and assume that they have
the technical skills to read through the code and fill in
all the lower-level details of your work (but that they
need a good sense of the “big picture” before doing so).</p>
<p>For example, if you added a new data structure called
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo_t</span></code>, it would be appropriate to mention that you
did so, and to describe the purpose of that data structure,
as well as any dependencies related to that data structure.
On the other hand, you would not include the full declaration
of that data structure, nor would you describe each individual
field. Instead, the goal is to convey that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo_t</span></code> is a data
structure relevant to your feature, and that anyone working
on that feature in the future will need to familiarize themselves
in it (and the assumption is that those students will just look
at the code to learn more about the specifics of that data structure).</p>
<p>Along those lines, you should not need to include any code
in this section of the report, although it can be
appropriate to show very short examples (3-4 lines) of how your code
might be called from other components. It is also appropriate
to link to specific parts of the chiventure code (e.g.,
following the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo_t</span></code> example above, you may want to specify
the exact file where the struct is defined, ideally with a link
to the file on GitHub).</p>
<p>There is no specific length requirement for this section, but we
expect any sufficiently-detailed section to be around 800-1200 words long.</p>
</section>
<section id="next-steps">
<h3>Next Steps<a class="headerlink" href="#next-steps" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Again, imagine that this report will be read by students who will
continue your work in following years. Describe at least four
tasks that those students could work on to continue the work
you did this quarter. These can include the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Tasks that you started working on this quarter, but were unable
to finish.</p></li>
<li><p>Improvements or fixes you identified this quarter, but did
not work on.</p></li>
<li><p>General interesting directions that the feature could go in.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that you can complete this section of the report
by simply pointing to specific GitHub issues (particularly Backlog issues)
that future students may want to focus on. If you do so, make sure
to include the issue number and issue title for each issue, along with
a 2-3 sentence summary of the issue.</p>
</section>
<section id="reflections">
<h3>Reflections<a class="headerlink" href="#reflections" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>You must discuss at least three (and no more than five) aspects of the
software development process which you found challenging and/or
rewarding. We encourage you to decouple these as much as possible from
the structure of this particular class. In other words, reflect upon
what aspects of developing software as part of a team (and with other
teams), and using the tools that facilitate this process (GitHub, Slack, etc.)
proved to be more challenging (and/or rewarding) than
simply working individually.</p>
<p>You must also discuss at least one thing that you would’ve done
differently with the benefit of hindsight.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="live-demo">
<h2>Live Demo<a class="headerlink" href="#live-demo" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>During the final exam slot for the class, you must run a demo of your
work meeting the following requirements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You must show a program in execution.</p></li>
<li><p>The program <em>must</em> use code you have written this quarter.</p></li>
<li><p>The code you run <em>must</em> be in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dev</span></code> branch of the repository.
You cannot demo code that is still in one of your branches and has
not gone through a code review. Note: The code doesn’t necessarily
have to be in the head of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dev</span></code> branch. If someone breaks
your code in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dev</span></code>, you can “rewind” to a previous commit in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dev</span></code>
if you prefer.</p></li>
<li><p>To ensure there is enough time for all the teams to showcase their
work, your demo should be around 5 minutes long, and never more
than 10 minutes long.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend that you think carefully about what you want to show
in your demo, and that you plan ahead of time the exact steps you
will take during the demo (as opposed to doing a more improvised demo).</p>
<p>Ideally, you should run the main <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chiventure</span></code> executable, in a way
that highlights the work you’ve done. However, if your feature is not
yet accessible from the main executable, you are allowed to create an
example program inside the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">examples/</span></code> directory of your feature.
Remember that you are allowed to use <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/uchicago-cs/chiventure/wiki/Writing-tests-and-demos-with-stubs,-fakes,-and-monkeypatches">in-memory games and monkeypatching</a>,
to build these kind of demos.</p>
<p>Please note that this is not “sandbox” code: this should be code that
integrates, as much as possible, with the rest of chiventure. A good way
to think about this is to write an example program that showcases the
work you were able to do, and that future developers can look at as an
example of how your code works.</p>
<p>Finally, time-permitting, we may ask you questions after your demo,
but your answers to these questions will not factor into your score.</p>
<section id="live-demo-tips">
<h3>Live Demo Tips<a class="headerlink" href="#live-demo-tips" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Doing a live demo may feel like a daunting task, particularly
because of the stress of something going wrong during the demo.
Here are a few tips on preparing/delivering the demo that
may be helpful:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Make sure you carefully plan what you’re going to say and
show at the demo, and rehearse it carefully. A live demo
is not something you want to improvise on-the-fly.</p></li>
<li><p>When it’s your time to demo, you should use a single laptop,
and that laptop must be ready to show the demo right away.
i.e., you must have a terminal open
that is ready to run your demo, and you should need to do
no setup other than connecting your laptop to the projector.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re unsure whether your laptop will work with the projector,
get to the room before 10am and do a quick test (we’ve checked,
and no one will be using the room before us)</p></li>
<li><p>Always have a contingency plan. Sometimes demos don’t work and,
while that is not ideal, you will not cause a bad impression
if you fall back on a contingency plan. For example, you could have
screenshots ready to show if the demo doesn’t work (note:
if that happens, we may ask you to show us the demo at a later
time so we can verify that it works)</p></li>
<li><p>If something does fail, do not try to fix it on the spot. Move on
with the rest of the demo and, if that is not possible, give up
on the demo gracefully (ideally by switching to your contingency plan)</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="submission-instructions">
<h2>Submission Instructions<a class="headerlink" href="#submission-instructions" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>As in the project design warm-up, your team will get a repository
shared by everyone in the team, and you must upload your report
to this repository. We will provide a simple Markdown template
for the report, but you are also welcome to use other formats
as long as they are text-based (e.g., plain text or HTML are fine;
PDF, Word, etc. are not acceptable)</p>
</section>
<section id="scoring">
<h2>Scoring<a class="headerlink" href="#scoring" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>You will receive a single ESNU score for the final report
and demo (i.e., not one score for each, but one score overall).
Since you only have one shot at the report and demo, the scoring
is largely based on the completeness of your final report and demo.
i.e., we will be paying more attention to whether you put in a
good-faith effort to provide the information requested in the report, regardless of
whether there is room for improvement in the report’s style,
level of detail, etc. Similarly, we will be looking at whether
you actually wrote a demo that meets the requirements listed above,
regardless of whether the demo could’ve showcased more aspects
of your work, etc.</p>
<p>The following issues will have an effect on your score in the
final report and demo:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Not completing any of the sections in the report, or not
providing the information requested for those sections.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing a clearly low-quality/low-effort report. In other words,
you should worry less about whether you’re writing an exceptional report
(although doing so never hurts), and more about making sure
you don’t write a report that is too informal, not useful, etc.
Examples of this could include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Writing the Design and Implementation section as list
of bullet points.</p></li>
<li><p>Pervasive lack of complete sentences, or pervasive bad
grammar.</p></li>
<li><p>Leaving TODOs or other notes in your report.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Not doing a live demo at all</p></li>
<li><p>Doing a live demo that does not fulfill the requirements listed
for the live demo.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Having your demo fail during the live demo will not necessarily
affect your score. If you are able to deal with that failure gracefully
(see the Live Demo Tips above), this will not affect your score.</p>
</section>
<section id="code-freezes">
<h2>Code Freezes<a class="headerlink" href="#code-freezes" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Please note that, leading up to the demos, there will
be two freezes on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dev</span></code> branch. Remember that your demo <strong>must</strong>
run code that is in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dev</span></code> branch.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Soft Freeze</strong>: Friday, May 27th at 11:59pm CDT</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Only issues/PRs that are open at this time will be reviewed and graded.</p></li>
<li><p>Issues/PRs can still be opened after the soft freeze (under a new milestone, “2022/Wrap-up”) but they will not be graded.</p></li>
<li><p>We cannot guarantee that PRs opened after the soft freeze will be reviewed/merged.</p></li>
<li><p>In general, we will not approve PRs that introduce a completely new feature, or that modify the core data structures of chiventure.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Code Freeze</strong>: Tuesday, May 31st at 5pm CDT</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No code will be merged after this time.</p></li>
<li><p>Exceptions may be made for very minor bugfixes and documentation updates, but we cannot guarantee they will be reviewed in a timely fashion.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
