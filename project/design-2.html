  <p><strong>Due:</strong> Wednesday, April 29th, 8pm CDT</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The late submission policy for labs does not apply to this
assignment. We will be discussing this design in class on Friday, May
1st, and need all submissions ready by then.</p>
<p>Good news, everyone! The first version of the Boardmaster 3000 has been
a resounding success! We got a lot of quality feedback from users, which
included comments like “the VR interface is like nothing I’ve seen
before”, “finally, a chess game that challenges both my intellect <em>and</em>
my senses”, and “the AI is creepily lifelike, in a good way, I guess”.
We know you were not involved in any of those aspects of the game, but
your modules for loading, manipulating, and saving the state of a game
were an indispensable building block that made the rest of the game
possible.</p>
<p>Encouraged by this early feedback on the first version of the game, we
are going to add more features to the Boardmaster 3000:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Support for two more games: checkers and Almost Chess</p></li>
<li><p>Support for square chessboards larger than 8x8</p></li>
<li><p>Support for pawn promotion in chess</p></li>
<li><p>Support for CBFv2, a new and improved file format for specifying
chessboard-based games</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this design exercise, you will revise your previous design to
accommodate these additional features.</p>
<div class="section" id="additional-games">
<h1>Additional games<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-games" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Boardmaster 3000 must now support
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts">checkers</a> (and,
specifically, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_draughts">International
Checkers</a>) and
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_Chess">Almost Chess</a>. Take into
account that, while we are only adding these two games right now, we
anticipate we will likely want to support more games in the future, so
our design should not be specific to just chess, checkers, and Almost
Chess, and should be easily extensible to support other games played on
a square chessboard. For example, it’s likely we will want to support
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capablanca_Chess">Capablanca Chess</a> in
the near future.</p>
<div class="section" id="international-checkers">
<h2>International Checkers<a class="headerlink" href="#international-checkers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We will follow the rules described in the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_draughts">International
draughts</a>
Wikipedia article. However, it is not our goal to support every possible
rule perfectly in our first implementation of checkers. You may make any
simplifying assumptions you want, as long as you support, at least,
moves by regular and crowned pieces, and single-piece captures. Take
into account this means you don’t have to support capturing multiple
pieces in successive jumps.</p>
<p>Take into account that checkers is played on a 10x10 board, an
additional requirement that is described further below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="almost-chess">
<h2>Almost Chess<a class="headerlink" href="#almost-chess" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_Chess">Almost Chess</a>, the
queen piece is replaced with a
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_(chess)">chancellor</a> piece,
which can move like a rook or a knight. Other than that, there are no
other changes to the rules.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="larger-chessboards">
<h1>Larger Chessboards<a class="headerlink" href="#larger-chessboards" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In part due to supporting checkers, we now have to be able to support
chessboards larger than 8x8. Besides the 10x10 chessboard, we may want
to also allow for chess to be played in chessboards larger than 8x8. You
may assume that, when using a larger chessboard, the game still starts
with 32 pieces, and that the exact initial arrangement will be an
implementation detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pawn-promotion">
<h1>Pawn Promotion<a class="headerlink" href="#pawn-promotion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>We will now support pawn promotion in chess: when a pawn reaches the
other end of the board, it can be promoted to a queen, rook, bishop, or
knight. We will continue to <em>not</em> support castling or <em>en passant</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="support-for-cbfv2">
<h1>Support for CBFv2<a class="headerlink" href="#support-for-cbfv2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The CBF format we used in the first design is insufficient to support
the new features being introduced in this new version of the Boardmaster
3000. Fortunately, there is a more advanced format, CBFv2, we can use.
Here is an example for a chess game:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">game</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">chess</span>
<span class="n">board</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">size</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">8</span>
<span class="n">p1</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">captured</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">PPNN</span>
<span class="n">P2</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">captured</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">q</span>

<span class="n">________</span>
<span class="n">n_______</span>
<span class="n">ppp_pppp</span>
<span class="n">r___kbnr</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here is an example for a checkers game:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">game</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">checkers</span>
<span class="n">board</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">size</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">10</span>
<span class="n">p1</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">captured</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">CCC</span>
<span class="n">p2</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">captured</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">c</span>
<span class="n">_C_C_C_C_C</span>
<span class="n">C_C_C_C_C_</span>
<span class="n">___C_C_C_C</span>
<span class="n">C_____C___</span>
<span class="n">_______C__</span>
<span class="n">__c_______</span>
<span class="n">_c_____c_c</span>
<span class="n">c_c_c_c_c_</span>
<span class="n">_c_c_c_c_c</span>
<span class="n">c_c_c_c_c_</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A few notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For Almost Chess, the game type is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">almost-chess</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">captured</span></code> fields refer to the pieces capture <em>by</em> that player
(not <em>from</em> that player). Player 1 (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p1</span></code>) is whatever player makes
the first move in the game.</p></li>
<li><p>In almost chess, a chancellor is represented with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">c</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>In checkers, a crowned piece is represented with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">k</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">K</span></code></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="your-task">
<h1>Your task<a class="headerlink" href="#your-task" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>You must modify the design you produced in the first design exercise to
support these additional requirements, possibly adding additional
modules. The number of changes required will depend on how
general-purpose you made your first design (so, having to make only a
few small changes is not necessarily a bad thing).</p>
<p>Take into account that the functionality provided by your modules is
still, essentially, the same as before:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Loading a game from disk</p></li>
<li><p>Saving a game to disk</p></li>
<li><p>Determining the following about the state of the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What piece (if any) is in position <em>x, y</em>?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the possible moves for the piece in position <em>x, y</em>?</p></li>
<li><p>Can piece in position (x0, y0) move to position (x1, y1)?</p></li>
<li><p>What piece (if any) will the piece in position (x0, y0) take if it
moves to position (x1, y1)</p></li>
<li><p>Can the piece in position <em>x, y</em> be taken by some other piece in
one move?</p></li>
<li><p>What pieces have been taken by a given player?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Changing the state of the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Move piece in position (x0, y0) to position (x1, y1), unless it is
an illegal move.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, you must take into account the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Moving a piece could result in the piece changing to a different type
(e.g., pawn promotion in chess and crowning in checkers). While this
could be treated as an implementation detail (if you make a move,
this is just a different way in which the internal state of the game
changes), your “move” function should supply this information in some
way (otherwise, the user of your module will have to check the state
of the piece after every move, to see whether it has changed)</p></li>
<li><p>Since we expect to support more games in the future, you should avoid
having a function for moving a chess piece and a function for moving
a checkers piece. Otherwise, if we end up supporting 50 games, we’ll
end up with 50 “move” functions! (and similarly with other functions
in your interface)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Like the previous exercise, remember that you should focus only on
specifying the <em>interface</em> of your modules, and not their
implementation. Make sure to review the <em>Deliverables</em> section of the
[first design exercise]({{&lt; relref “design-1.md” &gt;}}), as your updated
design should follow the same guidelines described there.</p>
<p>Besides the C code that specifies your design, you should also answer
the following questions in your README file:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In general, what major changes (if any) did you have to make to your
design to accommodate the additional requirements?</p></li>
<li><p>In hindsight, what (if anything) would you have done differently in
your original design that would’ve made it easier to add support for
these additional requirements?</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="creating-your-shared-team-repository">
<h1>Creating your shared team repository<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-your-shared-team-repository" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Like the previous design exercise, you will have to follow an
<em>invitation URL</em> to create a repository. However, since the teams were
already created in the previous design exercise, the invitation URL will
show you all the existing teams, and all you need to do is select yours.</p>
<p>If you join the wrong team, or mistakenly create a duplicate team,
please notify an instructor/TA.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="submission-instructions">
<h1>Submission Instructions<a class="headerlink" href="#submission-instructions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Before submitting, make sure you’ve added, committed, and pushed all
your code to GitHub.</p>
<p>You will submit your code through Gradescope. Please note that only one
team member needs to make the submission (that team member will be given
the option to specify who else is in their team). When submitting, you
will be given the option of manually uploading files, or of uploading a
GitHub repository (we recommend the latter, as this ensures you are
uploading exactly the files that are in your repository). If you upload
your repository, make sure you select your
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2020-design2-GITHUB_USERNAMES</span></code> repository, with “master” as the
branch. Please note that you can submit as many times as you want before
the deadline.</p>
