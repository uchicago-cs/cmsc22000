<p>The final component of this course will be a series of final presentations, where each team will present the work they have done throughout the quarter. The presentations will take place on Wednesday, June 12, from 1:30pm to 3:30pm, in Ryerson 277. Each team will have 15 minutes to present (with an additional 5 minutes for questions).</p>
<h2 id="presentation-contents">Presentation Contents</h2>
<p>Each presentation must be divided into three portions: a high-level discussion of how you designed and implemented your component, a demo, and reflections.</p>
<h3 id="design-and-implementation">Design and Implementation</h3>
<p>You must explain, at a high-level, the design of your component, and any non-trivial implementation details (like the use of external libraries)</p>
<h3 id="demo">Demo</h3>
<p>You must do a live demo of chiventure that specifically highlights the work your team was responsible for. You must do this demo from the version of the code that is in <code>master</code>.</p>
<h3 id="reflections">Reflections</h3>
<p>You must discuss at least three (and no more than five) aspects of the software development process which you found challenging and/or rewarding. We encourage you to decouple these as much as possible from the structure of this particular class. In other words, reflect upon what aspects of developing software as part of a team (and with other teams), and using the tools that facilitate this process (GitHub, Slack, Travis, etc.) proved to be more challenging (and/or rewarding) than simply working individually.</p>
<p>You must also discuss at least one thing that you would&rsquo;ve done differently with the benefit of hindsight.</p>
<h2 id="presentation-format">Presentation Format</h2>
<p>We suggest you allocate roughly 5 minutes for each portion of the presentation. That said, it would be prudent to plan to speak for no more than 12-13 minutes, to give yourself some wiggle room. Please note that the design/implementation and demo portions can be interwoven together, as opposed to treating them as completely distinct portions.</p>
<p>Take into account that the demo/presentation itself doesn&rsquo;t have to be delivered by all team members. In fact, for a 15 minute presentation, you probably want no more than 2-3 people speaking in total (but as many of you should be at the presentation, in case there are any questions that need to be answered by a specific team member)</p>
<p>You do not need to dress formally for the presentations. Casual clothing is more than acceptable but, if you do feel the need to look a bit sharper, please don&rsquo;t wear anything more formal than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_casual">smart casual</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_casual">business casual</a>.</p>
<h2 id="scoring">Scoring</h2>
<p>The presentation will be worth 10 points of your final grade. 6 of these points will be determined by the instructor and TAs, and the remaining 4 points will be determined by a panel of guest judges. The  instructor/TAs will score your presentation (on a scale of 0 to 5) on three aspects: Clarity/structure (weighed 40%), demo (weighed 35%) and Q&amp;A (weighed 25%). The guest judges will score your presentation only on clarity/structure (75%) and Q&amp;A (25%).</p>
<p>Both the instructor/TAs and guest judges will use the following rubric, with discretion to add/subtract half a point.</p>
<h3 id="clarity-and-structure">Clarity and structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>5 points: Flawless presentation.</li>
<li>4 points: Overall well structured. Only a few minor hiccups and/or aspects that were not entirely clear.</li>
<li>2.5 points: Needs improvement. Presentation was poorly structured with multiple aspects that were not clear.</li>
<li>1 point: Poorly structured. Presentation does not substantially address the content we requested.</li>
<li>0: No presentation was delivered.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="demo-instructortas-only">Demo (instructor/TAs only)</h3>
<ul>
<li>5 points: Flawless demo that highlights the team&rsquo;s work.</li>
<li>4 points: Smooth demo with only a few small hiccups.</li>
<li>2.5 points: Needs improvement. Demo worked but with major issues.</li>
<li>1 point: Very incomplete demo. Demo hints at the work the team did, but doesn&rsquo;t directly showcase their work.</li>
<li>0: No demo was done.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h3>
<ul>
<li>5 points: All questions were answered</li>
<li>4 points: Most questions were answered, but the team was stumped on some of them.</li>
<li>2.5 points: The team was stumped on most of the questions they were asked.</li>
<li>1 point: The team was stumped on all questions.</li>
<li>0 points: The team did not answer any of the questions they were asked.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="presentation-and-demo-tips">Presentation and demo tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;re unsure whether your laptop will work with the projector, get to the room before 1:30pm and do a quick test (I have verified that no one is using it before us)</li>
<li>You should make sure to present from a single laptop, and you should run through the demo on that laptop a couple times before the actual presentation.</li>
<li>You should declare the <code>master</code> branch to be frozen at some point before the presentations (and after you have run through a successful demo with the code in that branch). We suggest aiming to freeze the <code>master</code> branch at least 24 hours before the presentation, and only allowing changes that do not affect your code (e.g., documentation changes, READMEs, etc.) or, at most, very small hotfixes.</li>
<li>Always have a contingency plan. Sometimes demos don&rsquo;t work and, while that is not ideal, you will not cause a bad impression if you bow out gracefully. Either give up on the demo immediately or, if the laptop is at least projecting, then have screenshots prepared to share with everyone.</li>
<li>When you have a limited amount of time, don&rsquo;t improvise your demo. Think about what you will show exactly, and stick to your script. If something fails, don&rsquo;t try to fix it on the spot. Move on with the rest of the demo and, if that is not possible, give up on the demo gracefully.</li>
</ul>
<p>Teams will be given an opportunity to do a dry run of their presentation. At this dry run, we would provide feedback on your presentation&rsquo;s structure and style, to make sure you have a chance to polish it up before the actual presentation.</p>
