<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>This website currently reflects the Spring 2022 offering of CMSC 22000. We are in
the process of updating this page for the Autumn 2023 offering of CMSC 22000,
which will include several major changes to the class. Most notably, the class
will now be taught in Python (instead of C) and will revolve around the development
of a Python-based web application.</p>
</div>
<section id="project-organization">
<h2>Project Organization<a class="headerlink" href="#project-organization" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this project, you will be divided into teams of five students, and
will work collaboratively (both within your team and between teams) on a
complex software system, <a class="reference external" href="chiventure.html">chiventure</a>, that will
involve improving existing code as well as designing and
implementing new functionality. You will be using several tools to
support the collaborative aspects of this project and, indeed, your
collaborative skills will be as important as your coding skills to be
successful in this project. The project will follow an agile process
that resembles (but does not exactly follow)
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a>.</p>
<p>Each team will be assigned to work on <a class="reference external" href="features.html">an existing or new feature of chiventure</a> (teams will have a
chance to express a preference, although we can’t guarantee we’ll be
able to assign each team to their preferred feature). In each team, a TA
will act as Senior Developer.</p>
</section>
<section id="project-timeline">
<h2>Project Timeline<a class="headerlink" href="#project-timeline" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The project will span seven weeks (Weeks 3 - 9), with a final review and
team presentations taking place during Finals Week. The seven weeks of
the project will be divided into a project kick-off and four sprints,
with sprint reviews happening on Mondays.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Week 3: Project kick-off. This week will be primarily used for you to
familiarize yourself with project and the exact work your team will
do.</p></li>
<li><p>Week 4: Sprint 1</p></li>
<li><p>Week 5: Sprint 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Weeks 6-7: Sprint 3</p></li>
<li><p>Weeks 8-9: Sprint 4</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="project-evaluation">
<h2>Project Evaluation<a class="headerlink" href="#project-evaluation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The project contributes the following scores to your final grade (please see
our <a class="reference external" href="../grading.html">Grading</a> page for details on how these scores
are used to compute your final grade):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The “Project Points” you accrue by completing issues and pull requests.</p></li>
<li><p>1 ESNU score from the Project Design Warm-up</p></li>
<li><p>1 SNU score from the Peer Feedback</p></li>
<li><p>1 ESNU score from the Final Presentation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike a traditional programming assignment or project, the exact final
outcome of the project is not known in advance. Of course, we will set
some high-level goals and requirements and, while those requirements
will help us measure whether the project is “done”, they are not a
strict rubric. As we’ll see in class, this is one of the strengths (and
challenges) of agile software development: you can re-evaluate
requirements and make design changes quickly, but there is no detailed
requirements document that you can use to check whether you’ve
contractually fulfilled your obligations to a customer.</p>
<section id="project-points">
<h3>Project Points<a class="headerlink" href="#project-points" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Because there is no “golden solution” to the project, you won’t be
assessed on how close you come to some idealized version of the project,
or on whether you’re meeting all the goals you set at the start of
the quarter. Instead, you will be evaluated on how well you follow
a software development process (in other words, we will not be assessing
the final product but, rather, the process that led to that product).</p>
<p>The most important component of this assessment is the issues and pull
requests you will be completing throughout the quarter. Each issue and
pull request will be scored using the ESNU scale and you will accrue
a certain number of points for a completed issue or pull request
as long as you earn, at least, an S.</p>
<p>You can find a detailed description of this aspect of the project
in the <a class="reference external" href="issue-pr-grading.html">Issue/PR Grading</a> page.</p>
</section>
<section id="design-warm-up">
<h3>Design Warm-up<a class="headerlink" href="#design-warm-up" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Before you start working on the project itself, you will work on a
design warm-up exercise that will allow you to practice some basic
software design skills. More details on this component of the
project can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="warmup.html">Design Warm-Up</a> page.</p>
</section>
<section id="peer-feedback">
<h3>Peer feedback<a class="headerlink" href="#peer-feedback" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Twice throughout the project, each student will provide feedback to two
other students in their own team. This is similar to a peer
evaluation/review (which are fairly common in large software projects),
except the feedback you provide will have no effect on the recipient’s
grade (whereas in a real project, these evaluations/reviews could affect
whether you get a raise, a promotion, etc.). Instead, we will be
assessing the feedback you provide to others.</p>
<p>At the end of Sprints 2 and 3, you will be assigned two peers who will
be providing you with feedback (you will know each other’s identities).
Before they provide you with feedback, you must think about what you
would like to receive feedback on. At the end of Sprint 2, you should
think about the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>What is something I’d like to improve or do better in the next
sprints?</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>After Sprint 3 (i.e., during the final Sprint 4), you should think about
the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>What is something I’d like to improve or do better the next time I
work in a complex software project and/or the next time I work in a
team?</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Based on this, you should prepare prompts for specific feedback, which
can range from organizational/teamwork aspects (e.g., wanting to improve
how you communicate with the rest of the team) to technical aspects
(e.g., wanting to improve your understanding of some programming
concepts), as well as from concrete to high-level. You are also welcome
to provide additional prompts that don’t originate from the above
questions. Once you have your prompt(s), you should convey them to the
students who will be providing you with feedback (you can communicate
this directly to them, via Slack, e-mail, etc.; you do not need to
include the instructor or TAs in this communication)</p>
<p>For example, you could provide prompts like the following (the first two
are examples of relatively high-level prompts, while the latter three
are more specific):</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>I feel like I’m using Slack and GitHub effectively, but I wonder if
there are any ways in which I could be using them more effectively.</p></li>
<li><p>I always procrastinate on my tasks until the 1-2 days before they are
due, and I’d like to make more steady progress throughout the sprint.
Do you have any suggestions on how I could do this?</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes I feel like I go off and work on one of my tasks, and when
I touch base with everyone else after a few days, some of the work
I’ve done turns out to be headed in the wrong direction, and it seems
like that could’ve been avoided if I had known what everyone else was
doing. How could I make sure I stay informed of everyone else’s
progress?</p></li>
<li><p>I feel like I sometimes derail conversations by getting too lost in
the weeds when talking about my work, even though I may have a
valuable point to make. Do you also feel like I’m doing this? If so,
what other ways do you think I could make this point instead of the
way I’m doing it now?</p></li>
<li><p>I know we create tasks at the start of each sprint, and I know which
ones I’m going to be working on but, if I’m working with other people
on the task, sometimes I’m not sure what exactly I should be working
on. How can I make sure this doesn’t happen?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After you convey these prompts to the students who will be giving you
feedback, they must convey that feedback to you. Please give your
feedback givers at least one day to think about your prompts; after
that, we encourage you to meet synchronously in-person or via Zoom
(ideally with both the feedback givers at the same time) to discuss your feedback (if
synchronously is hard to arrange, they can also convey their feedback
over Slack, e-mail, etc.)</p>
<p>In the end, you must write a brief report (at least 3-4 paragraphs, and
ideally no more than 700 words) for each of the two pieces of feedback
you provide (each to a separate student). This report must include the
following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The prompts you were given</p></li>
<li><p>How the feedback was conveyed. If you met in person, please specify
when, for how long, and whether it was a one-on-one meeting, or
whether the other feedback giver was there.</p></li>
<li><p>A summary of the feedback you conveyed.</p></li>
<li><p>For the second round of peer feedbacks, mention whether there was any
follow-up on the feedback you provided in the first round of feedback
(e.g., if the feedback recipient acted on some of your feedback, and
told you the outcome).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will provide submission instructions once we are closer to the peer
feedback.</p>
<p>You will receive a single SNU score for the peer feedbacks, based on
whether your reports include the information requested above. In general,
if you provide the information requested above in the first round of
peer feedbacks, you will receive a Satisfactory. As long as you provide
the same information, at roughly the same level of detail, at the second
round of peer feedbacks, you will receive a Satisfactory overall for the
peer feedbacks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if your first round of peer feedbacks is deficient in any way, you
will receive a score of Needs Improvement, along with a list of
things you will need to improve in the second round of peer feedbacks.
If those issues are addressed in the second round, your score for the
peer feedbacks will be a Satisfactory (otherwise, it will remain at
Needs Improvement).</p>

<h3>Final Report and Demo<a class="headerlink" href="#final-report-and-demo" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Requirements for the final report and demo can be found <a class="reference external" href="presentation.html">here</a>.</p>

</section>
<section id="team-composition-and-mobility">
<h2>Team Composition and Mobility<a class="headerlink" href="#team-composition-and-mobility" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>You will be assigned to teams based on your answers to a team assignment
survey. At the start of the project, the composition of these teams will
be immovable: please do not ask us to change it.</p>
<p>However, it is not uncommon in software projects for developers to
interest themselves in the work done by other teams. So, if you find
another team’s work to be interesting, we encourage you to look through
the code they’re writing, poke your head into their Slack channel, etc.
You can even offer to help with some of their tasks (especially
backlogged tasks), which will also earn you points. Just make sure
you’re still completing the tasks for your team, and that you discuss
with the other team before you do any work on one of their tasks (e.g.,
“Hey, I saw issue #XXX in your backlog and I may have some extra time to
work on that. Is that ok?”)</p>
<p>Sometimes, these collaborations result in someone becoming so interested
in another team’s work that they end up asking to be reassigned to that
team. In this class, you will be allowed to switch to a different team
after the 2nd sprint, as long as the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You must have been doing some work for the other team already, and
must be able to point to completed tasks related to that team.</p></li>
<li><p>The switch should be motivated by the work the other team is doing,
and because you want to be involved in it. We will not allow you to
switch just because you want to be in a team with a particular person
from that team.</p></li>
<li><p>Both teams (including the senior developer for each team) must be ok
with this switch.</p></li>
<li><p>No team can end up with less than 4 members, or with more than 6
members.</p></li>
</ul>
