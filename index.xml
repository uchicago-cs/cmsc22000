      <description>Does CMSC 22000 fulfill any CS major requirements?
Yes, it can be counted as an elective in the CS major.
Can CMSC 22000 be used as a replacement for CMSC 15400?
No, CMSC 15400 is still required in the CS major. However, you are allowed to take CMSC 22000 between CMSC 15200 / 16200 and CMSC 15400.
Can I take CMSC 22000 concurrently with CMSC 15400?
This is technically possible, but strongly discouraged.</description>

      <description>Each team will be assigned to work on a specific feature of chiventure. Each team will have a chance to express a preference, and we will aim to assign each team to a feature they have expressed very high interest in.
Types of features Broadly speaking, there are two types of features you will be able to work on: those that involve improving and maintaining existing code in chiventure, and those that involve implementing new features.</description>

      <description>Course Description Developing a software system (e.g., an application, a web server, an operating system, etc.) requires much more than just knowing how to program. Software development encompasses multiple activities, such as systems design, implementation, testing, debugging, deployment, documentation, and maintenance, all weaved together by following a specific methodology. Not just that, software development is a highly collaborative activity, where certain soft skills, like effective communication and the ability to give/receive feedback, can be key to the success of a software project.</description>

      <title>Getting help on the lab assignments</title>

      <description>If you have any questions or get stuck on the lab assignments, there are two ways of getting help:
Slack We have a #course-labs channel on our Slack workspace that can be used to ask questions about the lab assignments. However, to keep that channel tidy we ask that you follow a couple of conventions in this channel.
The most important convention is that there should be one &amp;ldquo;thread&amp;rdquo; per question.</description>

      <title>Lab 1: Git</title>
      <link>https://uchicago-cs.github.io/cmsc22000/labs/lab1/</link>

      <description>Due: Wednesday, April 15th, 8pm
 NOTE: This lab is based on a Linux and Git lab originally written by Anne Rogers for CMSC 12100 (and updated and edited by a variety of instructors and TAs throughout the years)  In some of your previous CS courses, you may have become familiar with using Subversion (SVN) to handle revision control (or version control) of your projects and assignments, and to submit your work for grading.</description>

      <title>Lab 2: Software Design</title>

      <description>Due: Wednesday, April 22nd, 8pm
In this lab, you will carry out some basic software design tasks. This lab will be shorter than in other labs, because you will also be working on a design warmup exercise with your project team. Please note that, while the design warmup exercise is due at the same time as this lab, it will be part of your project score (it is not counted as an additional lab assignment).</description>

      <description>Final Presentations  NOTE: These are the requirements for the 2019 edition of CMSC 22000. They have not yet been updated for 2020!  The final component of this course will be a series of final presentations, where each team will present the work they have done throughout the quarter. The presentations will take place on Wednesday, June 12, from 1:30pm to 3:30pm, in Ryerson 277. Each team will have 15 minutes to present (with an additional 5 minutes for questions).</description>

      <description>You wake up to find yourself in a strange hall. You have no idea how you got here. The last thing you remember is a blinding flash of light. You look at the tapestries lining the walls for any clues on your whereabouts. The tapestries depict valiant knights, fire-breathing wyverns, armies of goblins, and fearsome rulers sitting in their gilded thrones. Wherever you are, it must be in a different world from your own.</description>

      <title>Design Exercise: Boardmaster 3000</title>

      <description>You have recently joined a software company that is developing an exciting new game: The Boardmaster 3000! This game will allow users to play a variety of two-player board games, all of which can be played on a square chessboard (like chess, checkers, and some variants of chess) However, we are following an incremental software development model, so we are going to start by supporting only chess. This will give us a chance to get some initial feedback on the Boardmaster 3000 before we move on to supporting other games.</description>

      <description>Good news, everyone! The first version of the Boardmaster 3000 has been a resounding success! We got a lot of quality feedback from users, which included comments like “the VR interface is like nothing I’ve seen before”, “finally, a chess game that challenges both my intellect and my senses”, and “the AI is creepily lifelike, in a good way, I guess”. We know you were not involved in any of those aspects of the game, but your modules for loading, manipulating, and saving the state of a game were an indispensable building block that made the rest of the game possible.</description>
