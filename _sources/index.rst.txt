Course Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This class expands on the software development topics introduced
in CMSC 14200 Introduction to Computer Science 2, and uses the
development of web-based applications as a vehicle to explore
several concepts that reoccur frequently in modern software development, such
as client/server software, databases, data modeling, APIs, software
deployment, and software observability. This class also emphasizes
how software development is a highly
collaborative activity, where certain skills, like effective
communication and the ability to give/receive feedback, can be key to
the success of a software project.

The class covers foundational topics in software development in
lectures, and will involve the development of a deployable web application
throughout a series of homeworks. The course also features a
collaborative quarter-long project, where the entire class, divided into
teams with specific responsibilities, will work on developing new
features for an existing software system.

Please see the `syllabus <syllabus.html>`__ for more details.
