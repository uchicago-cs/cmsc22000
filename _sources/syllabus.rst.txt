.. warning::


    This website currently reflects the Spring 2022 offering of CMSC 22000. We are in
    the process of updating this page for the Autumn 2023 offering of CMSC 22000,
    which will include several major changes to the class. Most notably, the class
    will now be taught in Python (instead of C) and will revolve around the development
    of a Python-based web application.

Course Description
------------------

Developing a software system (e.g., an application, a web server, an
operating system, etc.) requires much more than just knowing how to
program. Software development encompasses multiple activities, such as
systems design, implementation, testing, debugging, deployment,
documentation, and maintenance, all weaved together by following a
specific methodology. Not just that, software development is a highly
collaborative activity, where certain skills, like effective
communication and the ability to give/receive feedback, can be key to
the success of a software project.

This class bridges the gap between knowing how to program and knowing
how to develop software: it is intended for students who have recently
completed CMSC 15200 Introduction to Computer Science 2 or CMSC 16200
Honors Introduction to Computer Science 2, and will cover fundamental
concepts and skills in software development, providing a solid
foundation before students move on to majors-level classes that require
developing complex software systems. The class will cover foundational
topics in software development in lectures, but will also include
hands-on homeworks, guest lectures from industry speakers, and a
collaborative quarter-long project, where the entire class, divided into
teams with specific responsibilities, will work on developing new
features for an existing software system.

In this course, students will learn how to…

-  … follow a software development process/methodology to manage the
   life cycle of a software system.
-  … use tools that support the software development process (e.g.,
   build systems, testing frameworks, debuggers, etc.)
-  … develop software collaboratively through (a) the use of tools,
   systems, and best practices available to facilitate that
   collaboration (e.g., version control systems, code reviews, task
   tracking, etc.), and (b) exercising collaborative skills
   (communication, giving/accepting feedback, etc.)

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Students must have taken CMSC 15200 or CMSC 16200.

In Spring 2022, students will have to apply to participate in this
class, and only students who took CMSC 15200 or CMSC 16200 in Spring
2021, Summer 2021, Autumn 2021, or Winter 2022 will be invited to apply
(*absolutely no exceptions will be made*).

Please note that CMSC 15400 is *not* a prerequisite for this class.
Students who are taking CMSC 15200/16200 in Winter 2022, and who end up
taking CMSC 22000, are strongly encouraged to defer CMSC 15400 until the
Fall, instead of taking CMSC 22000 and CMSC 15400 concurrently.

Course Organization
-------------------

The class meets in-person three times a week for lectures (MWF 2:30pm - 3:20pm in Ryerson 251).
Additionally, we have time reserved on Mondays 4:30pm-5:50pm for project
teams meetings (this is listed as a “lab” on the Registrar’s site, but
please note that it is not a traditional lab session). These project team
meetings will start on Week 3, but we will also be scheduling other
activities during the Week 1 and Week 2 lab slots.

A large part of the class will revolve around the development of a
software project where students will be able to apply many of the
concepts covered in the lectures (this project is described in more
detail in the “Course Project” section below). In this project, the
entire class will work on the same code (through a public GitHub
repository visible to the entire class). Students will be divided into
teams of 4-5 students, and each team will work on a specific aspect of
the project. In each team, a TA will act as the senior developer in the
team. Students will be assessed both on their performance as a team, as
well as on their performance on individual tasks assigned to them in
their teams.

During the first two weeks of the quarter, the class will focus on
covering core concepts regarding the software development process.
Starting in week 3, the focus of the class will shift towards the
development of the course project, and the lecture sessions
will switch to the following:

* **Mondays**: Sprint reviews and all-hands meetings
* **Wednesdays**: Traditional lecture (supplemented with some pre-recorded lectures)
* **Friday**: Guest lecture / Panel discussion with outside speakers

For a complete schedule of lectures and other milestones, please see
the `Course Calendar <calendar.html>`__.

Homework
~~~~~~~~

Weekly homework assignments will supplement the material covered in lectures, and
will allow students to learn and practice skills that will be necessary
in the course project. These assignments must be completed individually.

Project
~~~~~~~

The course project revolves around developing a complex software system.
The scope and complexity of this project will require that the entire
class work together towards developing a fully-featured software
product.

More specifically, the entire class will be working on the same
codebase. The class will be divided into teams of 4-5 students, with an
undergraduate TA acting as a “senior developer” in each of these teams
(TAs will be students who have previously taken CMSC 22000 and/or who
have prior industry experience via internships). Teams will be arranged
by the instructor/TAs (they will not be self-selecting).

During Weeks 2-3, the teams will work on a warmup exercise on software
design. A design exercise will be assigned in Week 2 (due Week 3), and a
follow-up exercise will be assigned in Week 3 (due Week 4). Teams will
get feedback on their first exercise before the second one is due, and
we will be discussing the first design exercise in class during Week 3.

Starting in Week 3, project planning will follow a Scrum-like process,
with weeks 3-9 of the quarter being divided into several sprints.
Starting on Week 3, all teams have an all-hands meeting during Monday
class hours, and each team will have an additional team meeting during
the lab section of the class. Teams will keep track of their tasks
through GitHub issues, with grading primarily based on their performance
on these tasks.

More details on the project can be found on the `Project <project/index.html>`__ page.

Books
-----

While this class does not have a required textbook, most of the Software
Engineering content draws heavily from Ian Sommerville’s book, `Software
Engineering <http://iansommerville.com/software-engineering-book/>`__.
The Software Design content also draws heavily from John Ousterhout's
`A Philosophy of Software Design <https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201>`__.

Please see the `Other Resources <resources/other.html>`__ page for a
number of other books and online resources covering much of the material
in this class.

Policies
--------

Code of Conduct for Course Staff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This class has a `Code of Conduct for Course Staff <code-of-conduct.html>`__.
We share this code of conduct with you (the students) so you know the
expectations we have set for our staff and, while we expect and hope they
will scrupulously follow this code of conduct, you should let us know if
you witness or experience a code of conduct violation. This will allow us
to continue to improve the student experience in this class, and to prevent
any issues from reocurring.

Policy on academic honesty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We take academic honesty very seriously in this class. Please make sure to
read our `Academic Honesty <academic-honesty.html>`__ page. Please note that
this policy applies primarily to the homework assignments,
which must be completed individually.

On the other hand, the project is structured
in such a way that you can collaborate and share code with anyone in the class,
and even use code you find on the Internet. However,
this can lead to a number of gray areas where it may be hard to tell if
your work is academically honest.

For example, the following are activities that may be considered academically
dishonest in other contexts, but are acceptable in the project:

- Taking a snippet of code you find on Stack Overflow (as long as you provide attribution)
- Adding a large piece of code not written by yourself (e.g., a third-party library), as long as you
  provide attribution and your use of that code does not violate the terms of a software license.
- Asking someone outside the class for help with writing your code, as long as you credit
  them somewhere.
- Posting on online forums for help with figuring out a issue with your code (we would prefer
  that you ask those questions directly to us but, to be clear, using external forums in this way
  is not forbidden).

In general, we will not be policing the attribution of small-scale contributions by outside
sources, but it is still important that you include those attributions from a documentation
perspective.

On the other hand, the following are examples of behaviour that would be considered
academically dishonest in the project:

- Having someone outside the class do your assigned tasks in the project (as opposed to
  just getting assistance from them)
- Taking credit for work that someone else in the class did. Please note that there are many situations
  where students will legitimately *share* credit for a piece of work;
  what would be unacceptable would be to falsely take sole credit for work you did not do,
  as a way to improve your score in the class.

If you are ever concerned that you may be doing something that could be considered academically
dishonest, please don't hesitate to ask us for clarification. We are always happy to answer
these kind of questions.

Diversity statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The University of Chicago is committed to diversity and rigorous inquiry that arises from multiple
perspectives. We concur with that commitment and also believe that we have the highest quality
interactions and can creatively solve more problems when we recognize and share our diversity. We thus
expect to maintain a productive learning environment based upon open communication, mutual respect,
and non-discrimination. We view the diversity that students bring to this class as a resource, strength and
benefit. It is our intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
sexuality, disability, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, religious background, and immigration status.
Any suggestions as to how to further such a positive and open environment in the class will be
appreciated and given serious consideration.
