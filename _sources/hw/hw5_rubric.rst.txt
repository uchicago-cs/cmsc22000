Homework 5 Rubric
=================

The grading of this project follows a specifications grading approach. If you have not already
done so, make sure to read our `Grading <../grading.html>`__ page for more details.

When grading your work, the graders will be checking for the following issues in your code. Please
note that some of the issues are labelled as "[Major]" (these will have a greater effect on your score
for the homework)

Task 1
------

- Did not write tests for ``segment_new``, ``segment_init``, or ``segment_free``
- Did not move the ``segment_intersect`` tests into test_segment.c
- Moved the ``segment_intersect`` tests into ``test_segment.c`` but did not update the test suite.
- Moved the ``segment_intersect`` tests into ``test_segment.c`` but didn't remove
  them from ``test_point.c`` (so they are unnecessarily being run twice)
- [Major] Did not write tests for ``on_segment`` or ``point_orientation``
- Wrote tests for ``on_segment``, but the black-box tests don't cover every possible return value
- Wrote tests for ``on_segment``, there are not at least two distinct white-box tests (covering
  two distinct aspects of the internal implementation of the function)
- Wrote tests for ``point_orientation``, but the black-box tests don't cover every possible return value.

Task 2
------
- [Major] Did not follow TDD at all (it is not apparent from the commit log that the tests were written
  before the functions' implementation; e.g., if there is a single commit that contains all the tests
  and the implementation of the respective functions)
- Did not follow TDD in some functions. If you are implementing each function one at a time, take care
  to commit the tests before you start implementing the function.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Did not write tests for ``circle_new``, ``circle_init``, or ``circle_free``.
- Did not write tests for ``circle_diameter``, ``circle_circumference``, or ``circle_area``.
  You must write at least one test for each of these functions.
=======
- Did not write tests for ``circle_new``, ``circle_init``, or ``circle_free``
- Did not write tests for ``circle_diameter``, ``circle_circumference``, or ``circle_area``
>>>>>>> f9a674f978fe69fcb323e845be2ebed15965b168
- ``circle_overlap`` tests have insufficient coverage. They must cover, at least, the following
  cases:

  - Non-overlapping circles
  - Circles that overlap at a singular point
  - Circles where the overlap area is non-zero
- [Major] Did not implement ``circle_overlap`` or any of its tests.

General
-------

- [Major] Any of the tests fail when run
- [Major] The tests fail to build
- Some of the tests are missing header comments
- [Major] None of the tests have header comments

ESNU Score
----------

The ESNU score will be determined as follows:

- Excellent: No major issues, and at most one other issue.
- Satisfactory: No major issues, and at most three other issues.
- Needs Improvement: At least one major issue, or five other issues.
- Ungradable: Two or more major issues.
