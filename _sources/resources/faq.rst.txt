CS 220 FAQs
===========

**Does CMSC 22000 fulfill any CS major requirements?**

Yes, it can be counted as an elective in the CS major.

**Can CMSC 22000 be used as a replacement for CMSC 15400?**

No, CMSC 15400 is still required in the CS major. However, you are
allowed to take CMSC 22000 between CMSC 15200 / 16200 and CMSC 15400.

**Can I take CMSC 22000 concurrently with CMSC 15400?**

This is technically possible, but strongly discouraged. From a curricular
perspective, you will get the most out of both classes if you take
CMSC 22000 first and then follow it up with CMSC 15400, 
instead of taking them at the same time.

Additionally, over the years, several students have pointed out that the
workload of taking CMSC 15400 and CMSC 22000 on the same quarter can be
hard to manage.

**What is the difference between CMSC 22000 and CMSC 22001?**

*CMSC 22001 - Software Construction* is intended primarily for students
who are farther along in the CS major (typically 3rd and 4th year
students), and revolves around designing a software project from scratch
(and covering the Software Engineering concepts and skills necessary to
do so).

*CMSC 22000 - Introduction to Software Development*, on the other hand,
is intended for students who are coming straight out of the CS intro
sequences and revolves around how to engage with larger software systems
than those you see in an intro sequence (but without designing those
systems from scratch). It covers a number of concepts/skills in software
development (and a little of software engineering) that can better
prepare students for taking 200-level classes that involve complex
software projects (specially systems classes like Networks, Operating
Systems, Parallel Computing, etc.)
